## API Documentation

SG Bookkeeper provides several internal APIs for extending and customizing the application:

### AccountingEngine API

```python
# Create a new journal entry
result = await accounting_engine.create_journal_entry(entry_data)

# Post a journal entry
result = await accounting_engine.post_journal_entry(entry_id, user_id)

# Reverse a journal entry
result = await accounting_engine.reverse_journal_entry(entry_id, reversal_date, description, user_id)

# Get account balance
balance = await accounting_engine.get_account_balance(account_id, as_of_date)
```

### TaxEngine API

```python
# Calculate GST for a transaction
tax_results = await tax_engine.calculate_transaction_taxes(transaction_data)

# Prepare GST F5 return
gst_return = await tax_engine.prepare_gst_return(start_date, end_date)

# Calculate income tax
tax_computation = await tax_engine.calculate_income_tax(fiscal_year)
```

### ReportingEngine API

```python
# Generate balance sheet
balance_sheet = await reporting_engine.generate_balance_sheet(as_of_date, comparative_date)

# Generate profit and loss statement
profit_loss = await reporting_engine.generate_profit_loss(start_date, end_date, comparative_start, comparative_end)

# Export report to PDF
pdf_data = await reporting_engine.export_report(report_data, "pdf")
```

See the [API Reference Documentation](https://yourusername.github.io/sg_bookkeeper/api) for complete details.
