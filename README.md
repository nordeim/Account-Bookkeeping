## Overview

SG Bookkeeper is a comprehensive, cross-platform desktop application designed to meet the accounting and bookkeeping needs of small to medium-sized businesses in Singapore. Built with Python and leveraging the power of PySide6 for a modern user interface and PostgreSQL for robust data management, it offers professional-grade financial tools tailored to Singapore's regulatory environment.

The application features a double-entry accounting core, GST management, financial reporting, and modules for essential business operations. Its goal is to provide an intuitive, powerful, and compliant solution that empowers business owners and accountants.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9 or higher (check with `python --version`)
-   PostgreSQL Server 14 or higher (running and accessible)
-   Poetry (Python packaging and dependency management tool). Install via `pip install poetry`.
-   Git (for cloning the repository)

### Developer Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sg_bookkeeper.git # Replace with actual URL
    cd sg_bookkeeper
    ```

2.  **Set Up Python Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    This command will create a virtual environment (if not already present in the project via `.venv`) and install all dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.

3.  **Prepare PostgreSQL Database and User:**
    *   Connect to your PostgreSQL instance as a superuser (e.g., `postgres`):
        ```bash
        sudo -u postgres psql
        ```
    *   Create a dedicated database user and database (replace passwords securely):
        ```sql
        CREATE USER sgbookkeeper_user WITH PASSWORD 'YourSecurePassword123!';
        -- Database will be created by db_init.py script, or you can create it:
        -- CREATE DATABASE sg_bookkeeper OWNER sgbookkeeper_user; 
        -- \q 
        ```
        *Note: The `db_init.py` script can create the database if it doesn't exist, using the admin credentials you provide to the script.*

4.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    *   The application looks for `config.ini` in a platform-specific user configuration directory. On Linux, this is typically `~/.config/SGBookkeeper/config.ini`.
    *   Copy or create `config.ini` in that location. Example content:
        ```ini
        [Database]
        username = sgbookkeeper_user
        password = YourSecurePassword123!
        host = localhost
        port = 5432
        database = sg_bookkeeper
        echo_sql = False 
        pool_min_size = 2
        pool_max_size = 10
        pool_recycle_seconds = 3600

        [Application]
        theme = light
        language = en
        ```
    *   Ensure the `username`, `password`, `host`, `port`, and `database` match your PostgreSQL setup.

5.  **Initialize the Database Schema and Seed Initial Data:**
    Run the database initialization script using Poetry. This script will create all necessary tables, views, functions, and populate essential default data.
    *   Use an admin PostgreSQL user (like `postgres` or one with `CREATEDB` rights) for the initial setup, as it needs to create the database and extensions if they don't exist.
    ```bash
    poetry run sg_bookkeeper_db_init --user postgres --password YOUR_POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD --dbname sg_bookkeeper --drop-existing
    ```
    *   `--drop-existing`: Use this flag with caution as it will delete the database if it already exists, ensuring a clean setup. Omit it if you want to preserve an existing `sg_bookkeeper` database (the script will then fail if tables conflict without `IF NOT EXISTS`).
    *   The script also sets a default `search_path` for the database for easier `psql` interaction.

6.  **Grant Privileges to Application User:**
    After the database is initialized (by the admin user like `postgres`), grant necessary privileges to your application user (`sgbookkeeper_user` in this example). Connect to `psql` as `postgres`:
    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres psql -d sg_bookkeeper 
    ```
    Then execute these grant commands (replace `sgbookkeeper_user` if you used a different name):
    ```sql
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA core, accounting, business, audit TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA core TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA accounting TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA business TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA audit TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA core TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA accounting TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA audit TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA business TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA core TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA accounting TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA audit TO sgbookkeeper_user;

    -- For future tables created by postgres user (or role running migrations)
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA core GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA accounting GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA business GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA audit GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA core GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA accounting GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA audit GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA business GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
    \q
    ```

7.  **Compile Qt Resources (Optional but Recommended):**
    For icons and other Qt resources to be bundled correctly, especially for packaging.
    ```bash
    poetry run pyside6-rcc resources/resources.qrc -o app/resources_rc.py
    ```
    If `app/resources_rc.py` is not found, the application will attempt to load resources from direct file paths relative to the `resources` directory.

8.  **Run the Application:**
    Ensure your `config.ini` points to `sgbookkeeper_user`.
    ```bash
    poetry run sg_bookkeeper
    ```

## Usage Guide

*(This section would be filled out as UI and workflows are developed. Currently, the application launches to a basic UI shell.)*

### First-Time Setup (Conceptual)
-   Initial launch would guide through Company Information, Fiscal Year setup, Chart of Accounts selection, and Admin User creation if not seeded.
-   Currently, `initial_data.sql` seeds some of this. The "Settings" tab allows viewing/editing company settings.

### Key Modules (Tabs)
-   **Dashboard**: Overview of financial health (To be implemented).
-   **Accounting**: Chart of Accounts, Journal Entries, Fiscal Period management (Chart of Accounts view is partially implemented).
-   **Customers**: Manage customer data and related transactions (To be implemented).
-   **Vendors**: Manage vendor data and related transactions (To be implemented).
-   **Banking**: Manage bank accounts, transactions, reconciliation (To be implemented).
-   **Reports**: Generate financial statements and tax reports (To be implemented).
-   **Settings**: Configure company details, application preferences (Partially implemented).
