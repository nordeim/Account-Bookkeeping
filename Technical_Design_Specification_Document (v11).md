### 2.2 Component Architecture

#### 2.2.1 Core Components (`app/core/`)
-   **`Application` (`app/main.py`)**: Subclass of `QApplication`. Manages the Qt event loop and bridges to a dedicated `asyncio` event loop running in a separate thread for background tasks. Handles splash screen and initial application setup.
-   **`ApplicationCore` (`app/core/application_core.py`)**:
    -   The central orchestrator. Initializes and provides access to all services and managers (e.g., `SecurityManager`, `SalesInvoiceManager`, `PurchaseInvoiceManager`). Manages application startup and shutdown routines.
    -   Now initializes and provides access to `PaymentService`, `PaymentManager`, `BankAccountService`, `BankAccountManager`, `BankTransactionService`, `BankTransactionManager`, and `AuditLogService`.
-   **`ConfigManager` (`app/core/config_manager.py`)**: Loads and manages application settings from `config.ini` located in a platform-specific user configuration directory.
-   **`DatabaseManager` (`app/core/database_manager.py`)**: Manages asynchronous PostgreSQL database connections using SQLAlchemy's async engine and an `asyncpg` connection pool. Handles session creation and management, including setting the `app.current_user_id` session variable for database audit triggers.
-   **`SecurityManager` (`app/core/security_manager.py`)**:
    -   Handles user authentication (password hashing with `bcrypt` and verification).
    -   Manages authorization through a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, checking permissions (`has_permission()`).
    -   Provides backend logic for User, Role, and Permission CRUD operations, directly interacting with ORM models.
    -   Tracks the `current_user` for the application session.
-   **`ModuleManager` (`app/core/module_manager.py`)**: A conceptual component for potential future dynamic loading of large application modules. Currently, modules are statically imported.

#### 2.2.2 Asynchronous Task Management (`app/main.py`)
-   A dedicated Python `threading.Thread` (`_ASYNC_LOOP_THREAD`) runs a persistent `asyncio` event loop (`_ASYNC_LOOP`).
-   The `schedule_task_from_qt(coroutine)` utility function safely schedules coroutines (typically manager or service methods initiated by UI actions) from the main Qt GUI thread onto the dedicated asyncio loop thread using `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`.
-   UI updates resulting from these asynchronous operations are marshaled back to the Qt main thread using `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` with `Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection`. Data is often serialized (e.g., to JSON) for thread-safe transfer.

#### 2.2.3 Services (Data Access Layer - `app/services/`)
Services implement the repository pattern, abstracting direct ORM query logic for data persistence and retrieval. Key services include:
-   **Core Services (`core_services.py`)**: `SequenceService`, `CompanySettingsService`, `ConfigurationService`.
-   **Accounting Services (`accounting_services.py`, `account_service.py`, etc.)**: `AccountService`, `JournalService`, `FiscalPeriodService`, `FiscalYearService`, `AccountTypeService`, `CurrencyService`, `ExchangeRateService`.
-   **Tax Services (`tax_service.py`)**: `TaxCodeService`, `GSTReturnService`.
-   **Business Services (`business_services.py`)**:
    *   `CustomerService`, `VendorService`, `ProductService`, `SalesInvoiceService`, `PurchaseInvoiceService`.
    *   `BankAccountService`: Handles CRUD and querying for `BankAccount` entities.
    *   `BankTransactionService`: Handles CRUD and querying for `BankTransaction` entities, especially for listing within a bank account.
    *   `PaymentService`: Handles CRUD for `Payment` and `PaymentAllocation` entities, ensuring transactional integrity for a payment and its allocations.
-   **Audit Services (`audit_services.py`)**:
    *   `AuditLogService`: Fetches data from `audit.audit_log` and `audit.data_change_history` with filtering and pagination for UI display.

#### 2.2.4 Managers (Business Logic Layer - `app/accounting/`, `app/tax/`, `app/business_logic/`, `app/reporting/`)
Managers encapsulate complex business workflows, validation logic, and coordinate operations between multiple services and DTOs.
-   **Accounting Managers**: `ChartOfAccountsManager`, `JournalEntryManager`, `FiscalPeriodManager`, `CurrencyManager`.
-   **Tax Managers**: `GSTManager`, `TaxCalculator`. (`IncomeTaxManager`, `WithholdingTaxManager` are stubs).
-   **Reporting Managers**: `FinancialStatementGenerator`, `ReportEngine`.
-   **Business Logic Managers**: `CustomerManager`, `VendorManager`, `ProductManager`, `SalesInvoiceManager`, `PurchaseInvoiceManager`.
    *   `SalesInvoiceManager`: Handles full lifecycle for sales invoices including draft CRUD and posting with JE creation.
    *   `PurchaseInvoiceManager`: Handles draft CRUD for purchase invoices, including validation and calculations. Posting logic is a stub.
    *   `BankAccountManager`: Manages CRUD operations for bank accounts, including validation (GL account link, currency).
    *   `BankTransactionManager`: Manages creation of manual bank transactions and listing transactions for an account. Relies on DB trigger for bank balance updates from transactions.
    *   `PaymentManager`: Orchestrates the creation of payments/receipts. Validates payment data and allocations, generates payment numbers, creates `Payment` and `PaymentAllocation` records, coordinates `JournalEntryManager` for posting financial JEs, and updates invoice balances.
-   **Tax Managers**:
    *   `GSTManager`: `prepare_gst_return_data` method now also collects detailed transaction breakdowns for each relevant GST F5 box.

#### 2.2.5 User Interface (Presentation Layer - `app/ui/`)
-   **`MainWindow` (`app/ui/main_window.py`)**: The main application window, using a `QTabWidget` to host different functional modules. It includes menus, a toolbar, and a status bar.
    *   Now includes a "Payments" tab.
-   **Module Widgets**: Each tab in `MainWindow` hosts a primary widget for a module:
    *   `DashboardWidget` (stub)
    *   `AccountingWidget` (hosts `ChartOfAccountsWidget`, `JournalEntriesWidget`)
    *   `SalesInvoicesWidget` (list view for sales invoices)
    *   `PurchaseInvoicesWidget` (list view for purchase invoices)
    *   `CustomersWidget`, `VendorsWidget`, `ProductsWidget` (list views for respective entities)
    *   `ReportsWidget` (UI for GST F5 and Financial Statements)
    *   `BankingWidget`: Re-architected to use a `QSplitter` for a master-detail view. Hosts `BankAccountsWidget` (master) and `BankTransactionsWidget` (detail).
    *   `BankAccountsWidget`: New widget for listing bank accounts with CRUD actions. Emits signals on selection change.
    *   `BankTransactionsWidget`: New widget to display transactions for a selected bank account. Allows adding manual transactions. Includes filtering.
    *   `PaymentsWidget`: New widget for listing customer and vendor payments, with filtering and action to create new payments.
    *   `SettingsWidget`: (hosts sub-tabs for Company Info, Fiscal Years, User Management, Role Management). Now includes an "Audit Logs" sub-tab hosting `AuditLogWidget`.
    *   `AuditLogWidget`: New widget with two sub-tabs ("Action Log", "Data Change History") for viewing and filtering audit records.
-   **Detail Widgets & Dialogs**: Specific screens for data entry, editing, or viewing details (e.g., `AccountDialog`, `SalesInvoiceDialog`, `PurchaseInvoiceDialog`, `UserDialog`, `RoleDialog`). These dialogs typically interact with their respective managers for data operations.
    *   `BankAccountDialog`: New dialog for creating/editing bank accounts.
    *   `BankTransactionDialog`: New dialog for manual entry of bank transactions.
    *   `PaymentDialog`: New dialog for recording payments/receipts, featuring a complex table for allocating payments to multiple outstanding invoices.
-   **Table Models**: Subclasses of `QAbstractTableModel` (e.g., `SalesInvoiceTableModel`, `PurchaseInvoiceTableModel`) are used to provide data to `QTableView` instances in list views.
    *   `BankAccountTableModel`: New model for `BankAccountsWidget`.
    *   `BankTransactionTableModel`: New model for `BankTransactionsWidget`.
    *   `PaymentTableModel`: New model for `PaymentsWidget`.
    *   `AuditLogTableModel`: New model for `AuditLogWidget`'s action log tab.
    *   `DataChangeHistoryTableModel`: New model for `AuditLogWidget`'s data changes tab.

### 2.3 Technology Stack
-   **Programming Language**: Python 3.9+ (actively tested up to 3.12).
-   **UI Framework**: PySide6 6.9.0+.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+.
-   **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ (utilizing asynchronous ORM features).
-   **Asynchronous DB Driver**: `asyncpg` for PostgreSQL.
-   **Data Validation (DTOs)**: Pydantic V2 (with `email-validator` for email string validation).
-   **Password Hashing**: `bcrypt`.
-   **Reporting Libraries**: `reportlab` for PDF generation, `openpyxl` for Excel generation.
-   **Dependency Management**: Poetry.
-   **Date/Time Utilities**: `python-dateutil`.

### 2.4 Design Patterns
The application incorporates several design patterns to enhance structure, maintainability, and scalability:
-   **Layered Architecture**: As described in Section 2.1.
-   **Model-View-Controller (MVC) / Model-View-Presenter (MVP)**: Broadly guides the separation of UI (View), data (Model - SQLAlchemy ORM, Pydantic DTOs), and application logic (Controller/Presenter - Managers, UI widget event handlers).
-   **Repository Pattern**: Implemented by Service classes in the Data Access Layer. They provide an abstraction for data access operations, decoupling business logic from direct ORM/database query details.
-   **Data Transfer Object (DTO)**: Pydantic models (`app/utils/pydantic_models.py`) are used for structured data exchange between the UI layer and the Business Logic Layer, providing validation and clear data contracts.
-   **Result Object Pattern**: A custom `Result` class (`app/utils/result.py`) is used by manager and service methods to return operation outcomes, clearly indicating success or failure and providing error messages or a value.
-   **Observer Pattern**: Qt's Signals and Slots mechanism is extensively used for communication between UI components and for handling UI updates in response to asynchronous operations.
-   **Dependency Injection (Conceptual)**: `ApplicationCore` acts as a central point for instantiating and providing services and managers, effectively injecting dependencies into components that require them.
-   **Singleton (Conceptual for `ApplicationCore`)**: `ApplicationCore` is instantiated once and accessed globally within the application context, typical for managing core services.

## 3. Data Architecture

## 3. Data Architecture

### 3.1 Database Schema Overview
The PostgreSQL database schema is foundational to the application and is meticulously defined in `scripts/schema.sql`. It is organized into four distinct schemas:
-   **`core`**: Contains system-level tables such as `users`, `roles`, `permissions`, `user_roles`, `role_permissions`, `company_settings`, `configuration` (for key-value app settings), and `sequences` (for document numbering).
-   **`accounting`**: Houses all core accounting tables, including `accounts`, `account_types`, `fiscal_years`, `fiscal_periods`, `journal_entries`, `journal_entry_lines`, `currencies`, `exchange_rates`, `tax_codes`, `gst_returns`, `budgets`, `budget_details`, `recurring_patterns`, `dimensions`, and `withholding_tax_certificates`.
-   **`business`**: Includes tables for business operational data: `customers`, `vendors`, `products`, `sales_invoices`, `sales_invoice_lines`, `purchase_invoices`, `purchase_invoice_lines`, `inventory_movements`, `bank_accounts`, `bank_transactions`, `payments`, and `payment_allocations`.
-   **`audit`**: Comprises tables for tracking changes: `audit_log` (for action summaries) and `data_change_history` (for field-level changes). These are primarily populated by database triggers defined in `schema.sql`.
-   **`business.bank_transactions` table**:
    *   Added `is_from_statement BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` to flag transactions imported from bank statements.
    *   Added `raw_statement_data JSONB NULL` to store the original parsed row data from an imported statement line.
-   **Triggers**:
    *   A new trigger `trg_update_bank_balance` on `business.bank_transactions` (AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) now calls `business.update_bank_account_balance_trigger_func()` to automatically update `business.bank_accounts.current_balance`.
    *   The `audit.log_data_change_trigger_func` is now also applied to `business.bank_accounts` and `business.bank_transactions`.
-   The `business.payments` and `business.payment_allocations` tables were already defined in the schema and support the new Payments module.

The schema enforces data integrity through primary keys, foreign keys, `CHECK` constraints, `UNIQUE` constraints, and `NOT NULL` constraints. Indexes are strategically placed for query performance.

### 3.2 SQLAlchemy ORM Models (`app/models/`)
SQLAlchemy ORM models provide the Python object-oriented interface to the database tables.
-   Models are organized into subdirectories under `app/models/` that mirror the database schema structure (e.g., `app/models/core/user.py`, `app/models/accounting/account.py`).
-   All models inherit from a common `Base` (from `sqlalchemy.orm.declarative_base()`).
-   A `TimestampMixin` provides `created_at` and `updated_at` columns with automatic timestamp management.
-   Most transactional tables include `created_by_user_id` and `updated_by_user_id` fields, linking to `core.users.id`, to support auditability.
-   Relationships between models (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) are defined using SQLAlchemy's `relationship()` construct, typically with `back_populates` for bidirectional navigation.
-   The Mapped ORM style (SQLAlchemy 2.0+) with type hints (`Mapped`, `mapped_column`) is used for clearer model definitions.
-   `app/models/business/bank_transaction.py`: Updated `BankTransaction` model to include `is_from_statement` and `raw_statement_data` fields.
-   `app/models/business/payment.py`: The `Payment` and `PaymentAllocation` models are utilized.
-   `app/models/audit/audit_log.py` and `app/models/audit/data_change_history.py`: These models map to the audit tables.

### 3.3 Data Transfer Objects (DTOs - `app/utils/pydantic_models.py`)
Pydantic models serve as DTOs for validating and structuring data passed between application layers, especially from the UI to managers.
-   Each major entity typically has a set of DTOs:
    *   `BaseData`: Common fields.
    *   `CreateData`: Fields required for creating a new entity, often including `user_id` from a `UserAuditData` mixin.
    *   `UpdateData`: Fields allowed for updating an existing entity, usually including `id` and `user_id`.
    *   `Data` (or entity name): Full representation of an entity, often used for returning detailed data.
    *   `SummaryData`: A slimmed-down version for list views.
-   DTOs include field type validations, constraints (e.g., `min_length`, `max_length`, `ge`, `le`), and custom validators (`@validator`, `@root_validator`) for more complex business rule checks (e.g., password confirmation, conditional field requirements).
-   Enums from `app/common/enums.py` are used for fields with predefined choices (e.g., `ProductTypeEnum`, `InvoiceStatusEnum`).
-   **Bank Account DTOs**: `BankAccountBaseData`, `BankAccountCreateData`, `BankAccountUpdateData`, `BankAccountSummaryData`.
-   **Bank Transaction DTOs**: `BankTransactionBaseData`, `BankTransactionCreateData`, `BankTransactionSummaryData`.
-   **Payment DTOs**: `PaymentAllocationBaseData`, `PaymentBaseData`, `PaymentCreateData`, `PaymentSummaryData`.
-   **Audit Log DTOs**: `AuditLogEntryData`, `DataChangeHistoryEntryData`.
-   **GST DTOs**: `GSTTransactionLineDetail` added, and `GSTReturnData` updated to include `detailed_breakdown`.
-   `SalesInvoiceSummaryData` and `PurchaseInvoiceSummaryData` updated to include `currency_code`.

### 3.4 Data Access Layer Interfaces (Services - `app/services/__init__.py`)
While a generic `IRepository` interface is defined, individual service classes often directly implement the required data access methods for their specific ORM model(s) without strictly adhering to all methods of a generic interface. They provide a clear contract for data operations. Examples:
-   `IAccountRepository`: Defines methods like `get_by_code`, `get_account_tree`.
-   `ISalesInvoiceRepository`: Defines methods like `get_by_invoice_no`, `get_all_summary`.
-   `IPurchaseInvoiceRepository`: Defines methods like `get_by_internal_ref_no`, `get_all_summary`.
-   `IBankAccountRepository`
-   `IBankTransactionRepository`
-   `IPaymentRepository`
-   `IAuditLogRepository`
-   `IDataChangeHistoryRepository`

    -   UI: `BankingWidget` (hosts master-detail), `BankAccountsWidget` (list view), `BankAccountDialog` (add/edit).
-   **Bank Transaction Entry**:
    -   Manager: `BankTransactionManager` (manual transaction creation, listing).
    *   Service: `BankTransactionService` (DB operations for `BankTransaction`).
    *   UI: `BankTransactionsWidget` (list view for selected account), `BankTransactionDialog` (manual entry).

### 4.7 Payments (`app/business_logic/payment_manager.py`, `app/ui/payments/`)
-   **Purpose**: Record customer receipts and vendor payments, allocate them to invoices, and generate corresponding financial postings.
-   **Payment Processing**:
    -   Manager: `PaymentManager` (validates data, generates payment numbers, creates `Payment` & `PaymentAllocation` records, orchestrates JE creation via `JournalEntryManager`, updates invoice balances).
    -   Service: `PaymentService` (DB operations for `Payment`, `PaymentAllocation`).
    -   UI: `PaymentsWidget` (list view with filters), `PaymentDialog` (add payment/receipt, with detailed invoice allocation table).

## 5. User Interface Implementation (`app/ui/`)
-   **Main Window (`MainWindow`)**: Serves as the primary application container with a tabbed interface for accessing different modules.
-   **Module Widgets**: Each major functional area (e.g., Sales, Purchases, Reports, Settings) has a dedicated widget hosted in a tab. These widgets typically contain toolbars, filter areas, and data display areas (often `QTableView` or `QTreeView`).
-   **Dialogs**: Used for creating new records or editing existing ones (e.g., `SalesInvoiceDialog`, `AccountDialog`). They feature forms for data input and interact with managers for data persistence.
-   **Table Models**: Custom `QAbstractTableModel` subclasses are used to feed data into `QTableView`s, providing flexibility in data display and formatting.
-   **Asynchronous Interaction**: UI elements initiate backend operations (manager calls) via `schedule_task_from_qt`. Callbacks or `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` are used to update the UI with results from these async tasks, ensuring the UI remains responsive.
-   **Data Validation**: Input validation is primarily handled by Pydantic DTOs (on data collection from UI) and then by manager classes before database operations. UI provides immediate feedback for some simple validation errors.
-   **Resource Management**: Icons and images are loaded from `resources/` directory, preferentially using a compiled Qt resource file (`app/resources_rc.py`) if available.
-   **BankingWidget**: Now a master-detail view. `BankAccountsWidget` lists bank accounts. Selecting an account populates `BankTransactionsWidget` with its transactions. Manual transactions can be added for the selected account.
-   **PaymentsWidget**: New top-level tab. Provides a list of payments with filters. Allows creation of new payments/receipts via `PaymentDialog`.
-   **PaymentDialog**: Complex dialog for entering payment details and allocating the payment amount across multiple outstanding sales or purchase invoices displayed in an interactive table.
-   **SettingsWidget**: Contains a new "Audit Logs" tab which hosts the `AuditLogWidget`.
-   **AuditLogWidget**: Provides tabbed views for "Action Log" and "Data Change History", each with filtering and paginated table displays.

## 6. Security Considerations
-   **Authentication**: User login is handled by `SecurityManager` using `bcrypt` for password hashing. Failed login attempts are tracked, and accounts can be locked.
-   **Authorization (RBAC)**: A granular permission system is in place. Permissions are defined and can be assigned to roles. Users are assigned roles. `SecurityManager.has_permission()` is used to check if the current user is authorized to perform an action. The "Administrator" role has all permissions by default and is protected.
-   **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive audit logging is implemented at the database level using triggers. The `DatabaseManager` sets a session variable `app.current_user_id` which is captured by these triggers to record who made the changes. Audit data is stored in `audit.audit_log` and `audit.data_change_history`.
-   **Data Integrity**: Enforced through database constraints, DTO validation, and business logic validation in managers.

## 7. Database Access Implementation
-   **`DatabaseManager`**: Manages the SQLAlchemy async engine and `asyncpg` connection pool. It is responsible for providing database sessions.
-   **Services (Repository Pattern)**: Service classes (e.g., `AccountService`, `SalesInvoiceService`) encapsulate data access logic for specific ORM models. They use SQLAlchemy's async session to perform CRUD operations and execute queries. Common methods include `get_by_id`, `get_all_summary`, `save`.
-   **ORM Models (`app/models/`)**: SQLAlchemy model classes define the mapping between Python objects and database tables. Relationships, constraints, and mixins (`TimestampMixin`) are defined here.
-   **Transactions**: Database operations that involve multiple steps (e.g., saving an invoice and its lines, posting an invoice and creating a JE) are typically handled within a single database session managed by `async with db_manager.session():`, ensuring atomicity. Manager methods often orchestrate these transactional units.

## 8. Deployment and Installation
-   **Prerequisites**: Python 3.9+, PostgreSQL 14+, Poetry.
-   **Setup**:
    1.  Clone repository.
    2.  Install dependencies using `poetry install`.
    3.  Configure database connection in `config.ini` (located in a platform-specific user config directory).
    4.  Initialize the database using `poetry run sg_bookkeeper_db_init --user <pg_admin_user> ...`. This script executes `scripts/schema.sql` (DDL) and `scripts/initial_data.sql` (seeding).
-   **Execution**: Run `poetry run sg_bookkeeper`.
-   Refer to `README.md` and `deployment_guide.md` for more detailed installation and setup instructions.

## 9. Conclusion
SG Bookkeeper version 12.0 marks significant progress with the implementation of a foundational Banking module (Account CRUD, basic manual transaction entry), a comprehensive Payments module (receipts/payments with invoice allocation and JE posting), enhanced GST F5 reporting (detailed Excel export), and a user interface for viewing system audit logs. These additions substantially increase the application's utility and move it closer to a feature-complete accounting solution. The architecture continues to support these expansions. Future work will focus on Bank Reconciliation, enriching the Dashboard, and critically, establishing a comprehensive automated testing suite.
