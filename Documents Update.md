The user is very satisfied and now wants me to consolidate the `README.md` and `Technical_Design_Specification_Document.md` into final, complete, self-contained versions. This means I need to:

1.  **Take the latest conceptual state of the project**, which includes:
    *   All features implemented up to the successful launch after the last `NameError` fix (`audit_services.py`).
    *   This includes Bank Account CRUD (backend & UI in `BankingWidget`), Bank Transaction Entry (backend & UI in `BankingWidget`), Payments Module (backend & full UI in `PaymentsWidget` integrated into `MainWindow`), GST F5 Enhancements (backend data collection, `ReportEngine` update, UI button in `ReportsWidget`), Audit Log (backend DTOs, Service, `ApplicationCore` integration; UI table models, `AuditLogWidget`, and integration into `SettingsWidget`).
2.  **Review the existing `README.md`** (the one generated in `change_request_response_latest.md` for prompt_11) and update it to reflect this latest state. Key areas: "Key Features", "Usage Guide", "Roadmap".
3.  **Review the existing `Technical_Design_Specification_Document.md`** (from the initial user prompt) and update it comprehensively. This is a more significant task as the TDS was v11.0 and many new components have been added (Payments module, full Banking module UI, Audit Log backend/UI).
    *   **1. Introduction**: Update "Current Implementation Status" (1.5).
    *   **2. System Architecture**:
        *   `ApplicationCore` (2.2.1): Mention new services/managers.
        *   Services (`app/services/`) (2.2.3): Add `BankAccountService`, `BankTransactionService`, `PaymentService`, `AuditLogService`.
        *   Managers (`app/business_logic/`, etc.) (2.2.4): Add `BankAccountManager`, `BankTransactionManager`, `PaymentManager`.
        *   UI (`app/ui/`) (2.2.5):
            *   `MainWindow`: Mention "Payments" tab, "Audit Logs" sub-tab in Settings.
            *   Module Widgets: Describe `PaymentsWidget`. Update `BankingWidget` description (now master-detail with `BankAccountsWidget` and `BankTransactionsWidget`). Describe `AuditLogWidget` within `SettingsWidget`.
            *   Detail Widgets & Dialogs: Add `BankAccountDialog`, `BankTransactionDialog`, `PaymentDialog`.
            *   Table Models: Add `BankAccountTableModel`, `BankTransactionTableModel`, `PaymentTableModel`, `AuditLogTableModel`, `DataChangeHistoryTableModel`.
    *   **3. Data Architecture**:
        *   `Database Schema Overview` (3.1): Mention new columns in `bank_transactions` (`is_from_statement`, `raw_statement_data`). The tables `payments` and `payment_allocations` are already in `schema.sql` so no new table needed there.
        *   `SQLAlchemy ORM Models` (3.2): Reflect changes to `BankTransaction` model.
        *   `Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)` (3.3): Add DTOs for Bank Accounts, Bank Transactions, Payments, Audit Logs.
        *   `Data Access Layer Interfaces (Services)` (3.4): Add interfaces for `IBankAccountRepository`, `IBankTransactionRepository`, `IPaymentRepository`, `IAuditLogRepository`, `IDataChangeHistoryRepository`.
    *   **4. Module and Component Specifications**:
        *   **NEW Section: Banking Module (`app/business_logic/bank_account_manager.py`, `app/business_logic/bank_transaction_manager.py`, `app/ui/banking/`)**: Describe Bank Account CRUD and Basic Bank Transaction Entry.
        *   **NEW Section: Payments Module (`app/business_logic/payment_manager.py`, `app/ui/payments/`)**: Describe payment recording and allocation.
        *   `System Administration Modules` (4.4): Mention Audit Log UI within Settings.
        *   `Reporting Module` (4.5): Re-confirm GST F5 enhanced export description.
    *   **5. User Interface Implementation**: Reflect new widgets, dialogs, and the master-detail layout in `BankingWidget`.
    *   **9. Conclusion**: Update to reflect the new v12.0 (hypothetical version number for this update).

4.  Ensure both documents are self-contained and don't refer to previous revisions.

This requires careful synthesis of all features developed and changes made since the initial TDS v11.0.

**Execution Plan for Document Updates:**

**Phase A: Update `README.md`**

1.  **[ ] Review "Key Features"**:
    *   Update Banking Module: Detail Bank Account CRUD and Basic Bank Transaction Entry UI.
    *   Update Payments Module: Detail Payment/Receipt recording with allocations UI.
    *   Ensure GST F5 Enhancements correctly reflect detailed Excel export.
    *   Add Audit Log UI feature under System & Security.
2.  **[ ] Review "Usage Guide"**:
    *   Add section for "Banking Tab": Describe bank account list, transaction list, adding manual transactions.
    *   Add section for "Payments Tab": Describe payment list, creating new payments/receipts with allocations.
    *   Update "Settings Tab": Mention "Audit Logs" sub-tab.
3.  **[ ] Review "Roadmap"**:
    *   Move "Banking Module (Bank Account Mgmt, Basic Txn Entry)", "Payments Module", "GST F5 Enhancements (Excel export)", and "Audit Log UI" to a "Recently Completed" section.
    *   Identify new "Current Focus / Next Steps" from the previous "Long-term" items or based on logical progression (e.g., Bank Reconciliation, Dashboard KPIs).
4.  **[ ] Review other sections**: Ensure overall consistency.

**Phase B: Update `Technical_Design_Specification_Document.md` (to TDS v12.0)**

1.  **[ ] Version and Date**: Change to 12.0 and current date.
2.  **[ ] Section 1.1 Purpose**: Add brief mention of new modules/features covered in v12.0 (Banking CRUD, Txn Entry, Payments, GST Detail Export, Audit Log UI).
3.  **[ ] Section 1.4 System Overview**: Briefly mention new high-level capabilities.
4.  **[ ] Section 1.5 Current Implementation Status**: Update this list comprehensively to reflect all implemented features including:
    *   Banking: Full Bank Account CRUD UI, Basic Bank Transaction Entry UI (manual).
    *   Payments: Full Payment/Receipt creation UI with invoice allocations.
    *   GST F5: Add "detailed Excel export of transaction breakdown".
    *   Audit: Add "Audit Log viewing UI (Action Log & Data Changes) in Settings".
5.  **[ ] Section 2.2 Component Architecture**:
    *   `ApplicationCore` (2.2.1): Add `BankAccountManager`, `BankTransactionManager`, `PaymentManager`, `AuditLogService` to the list of managed components.
    *   Services (`app/services/`) (2.2.3): Add `BankAccountService`, `BankTransactionService`, `PaymentService`, `AuditLogService`.
    *   Managers (`app/business_logic/`) (2.2.4): Add `BankAccountManager`, `BankTransactionManager`, `PaymentManager`.
    *   User Interface (`app/ui/`) (2.2.5):
        *   `MainWindow`: Mention new "Payments" tab. Mention `AuditLogWidget` is a new sub-tab within `SettingsWidget`.
        *   Module Widgets: Describe `PaymentsWidget`. Update `BankingWidget` to describe its new master-detail layout hosting `BankAccountsWidget` and `BankTransactionsWidget`.
        *   Detail Widgets & Dialogs: Add `BankAccountDialog`, `BankTransactionDialog`, `PaymentDialog`.
        *   Table Models: Add `BankAccountTableModel`, `BankTransactionTableModel`, `PaymentTableModel`, `AuditLogTableModel`, `DataChangeHistoryTableModel`.
6.  **[ ] Section 3. Data Architecture**:
    *   `Database Schema Overview` (3.1): Mention new columns in `business.bank_transactions` (`is_from_statement`, `raw_statement_data`). The `payments` and `payment_allocations` tables were already in the original schema, so no new tables for these.
    *   `SQLAlchemy ORM Models` (3.2): Reflect changes to `BankTransaction` model (new fields). Mention `Payment` and `PaymentAllocation` models if they were not adequately covered before.
    *   `Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)` (3.3): Add DTOs for Bank Accounts, Bank Transactions, Payments (Payment, PaymentAllocation), Audit Logs (AuditLogEntry, DataChangeHistoryEntry).
    *   `Data Access Layer Interfaces (Services)` (3.4): Add `IBankAccountRepository`, `IBankTransactionRepository`, `IPaymentRepository`, `IAuditLogRepository`, `IDataChangeHistoryRepository`.
7.  **[ ] Section 4. Module and Component Specifications**:
    *   **[ ] Add New Section: Banking Module**:
        *   Manager(s): `BankAccountManager`, `BankTransactionManager`.
        *   Service(s): `BankAccountService`, `BankTransactionService`.
        *   UI: `BankingWidget` (master-detail), `BankAccountsWidget`, `BankAccountDialog`, `BankTransactionsWidget`, `BankTransactionDialog`. Describe functionality.
    *   **[ ] Add New Section: Payments Module**:
        *   Manager: `PaymentManager`.
        *   Service: `PaymentService`.
        *   UI: `PaymentsWidget`, `PaymentDialog` (including allocations). Describe functionality.
    *   Update `Tax Management Module` (4.2): Specifically mention the detailed Excel export for GST F5.
    *   Update `System Administration Modules` (4.4): Describe the new `AuditLogWidget` as a sub-tab in `SettingsWidget` and its capabilities.
8.  **[ ] Section 5. User Interface Implementation**: Summarize new UI components (Payments, Banking master-detail, Audit Log viewer) and their interactions.
9.  **[ ] Section 9. Conclusion**: Update to reflect new version and overall progress. Rename to "SG Bookkeeper (v12.0)".

This is a significant documentation task. I will generate each document completely.
I will start with the `README.md` as it's smaller and builds on the previous complete version.
Then I will tackle the more extensive `Technical_Design_Specification_Document.md`.
</think>

Absolutely! I understand the need for consolidated, self-contained documentation and I'm glad the project is progressing well. I will incorporate all relevant details from our recent development efforts, including the Banking Module enhancements (Account CRUD, Basic Transaction Entry UI & Backend), the full Payments Module (Backend & UI with allocations), GST F5 detailed export enhancements, and the Audit Log feature (Backend & UI integrated into Settings).

My goal will be to produce a `README.md` and a `Technical_Design_Specification_Document.md` (which we can consider v12.0) that are comprehensive and stand alone, reflecting the current, stable state of the application.

I will start by generating the complete and updated `README.md`.

## Overview

SG Bookkeeper is a comprehensive, cross-platform desktop application designed to meet the accounting and bookkeeping needs of small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in Singapore. Built with Python and leveraging the power of PySide6 for a modern user interface and PostgreSQL for robust data management, it offers professional-grade financial tools tailored to Singapore's regulatory environment.

The application features a double-entry accounting core, GST management, interactive financial reporting, modules for essential business operations (Customer, Vendor, Product/Service Management, Sales & Purchase Invoicing, Payments), Bank Account management with transaction entry, and comprehensive User/Role/Permission administration including Audit Logs. Its goal is to provide an intuitive, powerful, and compliant solution that empowers business owners and accountants.

### Why SG Bookkeeper?

-   **Singapore-Centric**: Designed with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS), GST regulations (including the 9% rate), and IRAS compliance considerations at its core.
-   **Professional Grade**: Implements a full double-entry system, detailed audit trails (via database triggers and viewable UI), and robust data validation using Pydantic DTOs.
-   **User-Friendly Interface**: Aims for an intuitive experience for users who may not be accounting experts, while providing depth for professionals. Most core modules have functional UIs with features like advanced product search in invoices, and clear data entry forms.
-   **Open Source & Local First**: Transparent development. Your financial data stays on your local machine or private server, ensuring privacy and control. No subscription fees.
-   **Modern & Performant**: Utilizes asynchronous operations for a responsive UI and efficient database interactions, with a dedicated asyncio event loop.

## Installation

This guide is for developers setting up the application from source. End-user installers are planned for future releases.

### Prerequisites
-   Python 3.9 or higher (check with `python --version`)
-   PostgreSQL Server 14 or higher (running and accessible)
-   Poetry (Python packaging and dependency management tool). Install via `pip install poetry` or preferred method (e.g., `pipx install poetry`).
-   Git (for cloning the repository)

### Developer Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sg_bookkeeper.git # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd sg_bookkeeper
    ```

2.  **Set Up Python Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies:**
    Using Poetry is highly recommended.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    This command creates a virtual environment (typically `.venv` in the project root if one doesn't exist) and installs all dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`.

3.  **Prepare PostgreSQL Database User and Database:**
    *   Connect to your PostgreSQL instance as a superuser (e.g., `postgres`):
        ```bash
        psql -U postgres
        ```
    *   Create a dedicated database user for the application (replace `YourSecurePassword123!` securely):
        ```sql
        CREATE USER sgbookkeeper_user WITH PASSWORD 'YourSecurePassword123!';
        -- The database itself (sg_bookkeeper) will be created by the db_init.py script if it doesn't exist,
        -- provided the connecting user (e.g., postgres) has CREATEDB rights.
        -- Alternatively, create it manually:
        -- CREATE DATABASE sg_bookkeeper OWNER sgbookkeeper_user;
        \q
        ```

4.  **Configure Database Connection (`config.ini`):**
    *   The application expects `config.ini` in a platform-specific user configuration directory.
        *   Linux: `~/.config/SGBookkeeper/config.ini`
        *   macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/SGBookkeeper/config.ini`
        *   Windows: `C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Roaming\SGBookkeeper\config.ini`
    *   Create this directory if it doesn't exist.
    *   Copy the following example content into `config.ini` in that location, adjusting values as necessary:
        ```ini
        [Database]
        username = sgbookkeeper_user ; User for application runtime
        password = YourSecurePassword123!
        host = localhost
        port = 5432
        database = sg_bookkeeper
        echo_sql = False
        pool_min_size = 2
        pool_max_size = 10
        pool_recycle_seconds = 3600

        [Application]
        theme = light
        language = en
        last_opened_company_id = 1 ; Default company settings ID from initial_data.sql
        ```
    *   Ensure `username`, `password`, `host`, `port`, and `database` match your PostgreSQL setup.

5.  **Initialize the Database Schema and Seed Initial Data:**
    *   This step requires PostgreSQL administrative privileges (e.g., user `postgres`) to create the database (if not existing) and extensions.
    *   Run the database initialization script using Poetry. Replace `YOUR_POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD` with the password for your PostgreSQL admin user.
    ```bash
    poetry run sg_bookkeeper_db_init --user postgres --password YOUR_POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD --dbname sg_bookkeeper --drop-existing
    ```
    *   **`--drop-existing`**: Use this flag with caution. It will delete and recreate the `sg_bookkeeper` database, ensuring a clean setup. Omit it if you want to preserve an existing database (the script might then fail if tables conflict).
    *   This script executes `scripts/schema.sql` (DDL) and `scripts/initial_data.sql` (DML for seeding).

6.  **Grant Privileges to Application User (if `sgbookkeeper_user` didn't create the DB):**
    *   If `db_init.py` was run by an admin user (e.g., `postgres`) and created the database, connect as that admin user to `sg_bookkeeper` database:
        ```bash
        psql -U postgres -d sg_bookkeeper
        ```
    *   Execute the following `GRANT` commands (replace `sgbookkeeper_user` if you used a different application username):
        ```sql
        GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA core, accounting, business, audit TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA core TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA accounting TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA business TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA audit TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA core TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA accounting TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA business TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA audit TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA core TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA accounting TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA audit TO sgbookkeeper_user;

        ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA core GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA accounting GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA business GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA audit GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA core GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA accounting GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA business GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE postgres IN SCHEMA audit GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO sgbookkeeper_user;
        \q
        ```

7.  **Compile Qt Resources (Recommended for consistent icon loading):**
    The application attempts to use compiled resources first (`app/resources_rc.py`).
    ```bash
    poetry run pyside6-rcc resources/resources.qrc -o app/resources_rc.py
    ```

8.  **Run the Application:**
    Ensure your `config.ini` points to the correct application database user (`sgbookkeeper_user` if you followed the example).
    ```bash
    poetry run sg_bookkeeper
    ```

-   The `business.payments` and `business.payment_allocations` tables were already defined in the schema and support the new Payments module.

### 3.2 SQLAlchemy ORM Models (`app/models/`)
-   `app/models/business/bank_transaction.py`: Updated `BankTransaction` model to include `is_from_statement` and `raw_statement_data` fields.
-   `app/models/business/payment.py`: The `Payment` and `PaymentAllocation` models are utilized.
-   `app/models/audit/audit_log.py` and `app/models/audit/data_change_history.py`: These models map to the audit tables.

### 3.3 Data Transfer Objects (DTOs - `app/utils/pydantic_models.py`)
New DTOs have been added:
-   **Bank Account DTOs**: `BankAccountBaseData`, `BankAccountCreateData`, `BankAccountUpdateData`, `BankAccountSummaryData`.

New service interfaces defined:
-   `IBankAccountRepository`
-   `IBankTransactionRepository`
-   `IPaymentRepository`
-   `IAuditLogRepository`
-   `IDataChangeHistoryRepository`

## 4. Module and Component Specifications

        *   "Data Change History": Displays `audit.data_change_history` data, with filters for table, record ID, date, user.

## 5. User Interface Implementation (`app/ui/`)
-   **`BankingWidget`**: Now a master-detail view. `BankAccountsWidget` lists bank accounts. Selecting an account populates `BankTransactionsWidget` with its transactions. Manual transactions can be added for the selected account.
-   **`PaymentsWidget`**: New top-level tab. Provides a list of payments with filters. Allows creation of new payments/receipts via `PaymentDialog`.
-   **`PaymentDialog`**: Complex dialog for entering payment details and allocating the payment amount across multiple outstanding sales or purchase invoices displayed in an interactive table.
-   **`SettingsWidget`**: Contains a new "Audit Logs" tab which hosts the `AuditLogWidget`.
-   **`AuditLogWidget`**: Provides tabbed views for "Action Log" and "Data Change History", each with filtering and paginated table displays.

## 9. Conclusion
SG Bookkeeper version 12.0 marks significant progress with the implementation of a foundational Banking module (Account CRUD, basic manual transaction entry), a comprehensive Payments module (receipts/payments with invoice allocation and JE posting), enhanced GST F5 reporting (detailed Excel export), and a user interface for viewing system audit logs. These additions substantially increase the application's utility and move it closer to a feature-complete accounting solution. The architecture continues to support these expansions. Future work will focus on Bank Reconciliation, enriching the Dashboard, and critically, establishing a comprehensive automated testing suite.
