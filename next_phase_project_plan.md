**Current Project Status Recap:**
        
*   **Sales Invoicing**: 
    *   Backend for Draft Management & Posting (`SalesInvoiceManager`): Complete.
    *   `SalesInvoiceDialog` (Create/Edit Drafts): Complete.
    *   `SalesInvoicesWidget` (List View & Post Action): Complete with refined user feedback.
*   All previously implemented features remain stable.
        
**Next Step Identification (from Roadmap):** 

Roadmap items for "Current Focus / Short-term":
1.  **Sales Invoicing**: Complete UI for listing, viewing, and managing Sales Invoices. Implement posting logic (JE creation). <-- *This is now very close to complete. The "Save & Approve" button in `SalesInvoiceDialog` is still a minor pending item but posting from list view is done.*
2.  **Refine Reporting**: Enhance on-screen display and export options for financial reports. <-- Addressed for BS/PL on-screen display. Further export refinements could be done.
3.  **User and Role Management UI**: Add UI in Settings for managing users, roles, and permissions. <-- This is a significant, independent feature that hasn't been started yet.

Given the substantial completion of the Sales Invoicing posting flow, and the recent refinement of BS/PL on-screen display, tackling **"User and Role Management UI"** seems like a good next major step. It's a core system feature often needed early.
            
The "Save & Approve" button in `SalesInvoiceDialog` could be considered a minor polish item for Sales Invoicing, but a full User/Role Management UI is a more substantial roadmap item. Let's prioritize the larger roadmap item.
                
**Plan for this Turn: Implement User and Role Management UI - Part 1 (User Management Tab in Settings).**
    
**Objective:** 
Create a new sub-tab within the `SettingsWidget` for "User Management". This tab will initially focus on listing users and allowing actions like Add User, Edit User, and Toggle Active Status. Role assignment will be a subsequent part.
As per the roadmap, the next major feature to tackle is **"User and Role Management UI"**. This is a crucial system feature. We'll start by implementing the User Management part.

**Plan for this Turn: User Management UI - Part 1 (List Users and Basic Actions)**

**Objective:**
1.  Create the necessary Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for user data presentation and manipulation.
2.  Extend `SecurityManager` with methods to support listing users, fetching user details for editing, toggling active status, and listing roles (for future use in dialogs).
3.  Create a new `UserManagementWidget` to be placed in a new "Users" tab within `SettingsWidget`.
4.  Implement `UserTableModel` to display user summaries in the `UserManagementWidget`.
5.  Set up the basic UI for `UserManagementWidget` including a table view and a toolbar with stubbed actions for Add, Edit, Toggle Active Status, and Change Password.

The actual `UserDialog` for adding/editing users and detailed role assignment will be handled in a subsequent part.
