**Next Step Identification (from Roadmap):**
                
The roadmap items for "Current Focus / Short-term" were:
1.  **Sales Invoicing**: Complete UI for listing, viewing, and managing Sales Invoices. **Implement posting logic (JE creation).** <-- This is the next part for Sales Invoicing.
2.  **Refine Reporting**: Enhance on-screen display and export options for financial reports.
3.  **User and Role Management UI**: Add UI in Settings for managing users, roles, and permissions.

The most direct continuation of the "Sales Invoicing" feature is to implement the posting logic.
                
**Plan for this Turn: Implement Sales Invoice Posting Logic.**
