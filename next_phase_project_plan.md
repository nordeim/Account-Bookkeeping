**Next Steps:**

1.  **Review `app/ui/customers/__init__.py`**: Ensure it exports `CustomersWidget`, `CustomerDialog`, and `CustomerTableModel`.
2.  **Review `app/ui/main_window.py`**: Ensure `CustomersWidget` is correctly instantiated and added as a tab.
3.  **Thorough Testing (Phase B - UI Testing & Phase 4 from overall plan)**: Manually test the entire Customer Management workflow:
    *   Listing customers (initially empty).
    *   Adding new customers (with validation).
    *   Viewing the list update.
    *   Editing existing customers.
    *   Toggling active status.
    *   Searching/filtering.
    *   Checking data persistence in the database (`business.customers` table).
    *   Checking audit logs for customer creation/updates.

After these files are updated in your project, the basic Customer Management module should be functional and testable.
