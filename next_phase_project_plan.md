**Current Project Status Recap:**
            
*   **User Management UI**:
    *   `UserManagementWidget`: Lists users. Actions: Add User (launches `UserDialog`), Edit User (launches `UserDialog`), Toggle Active User, Change Password (launches `UserPasswordDialog`).
    *   `UserDialog`: Supports creating new users and editing existing users, including role assignments.
    *   `UserPasswordDialog`: Supports changing a user's password.
    *   `SecurityManager`: Contains backend methods for all these operations.
*   All previously implemented features remain stable.
            
**Next Step Identification (from Roadmap):**

Roadmap Item: **"User and Role Management UI**: Add UI in Settings for managing users, roles, and permissions."
We have substantially completed the "User Management" part. The next logical component is "Role Management" and then "Permission Assignment to Roles".
            
**Plan for this Turn: Role and Permission Management UI - Part 1 (Role Listing and Basic CRUD Dialog).**
            
**Objective:**  
1.  Create a new sub-tab within `SettingsWidget` for "Role Management" (alongside "Users").
2.  This tab will list existing roles.
3.  Implement a `RoleDialog` to allow adding new roles and editing existing role names/descriptions.
4.  Permission assignment to roles will be Part 2 for this sub-module.
