**Current Project Status Recap:**

*   **Basic Vendor Management Module (Backend & Frontend UI)**: Complete and stable at startup. Functional testing is the next step for this specific module.
*   **Basic Customer Management Module (Backend & Frontend UI)**: Complete and stable.
*   All previously implemented core accounting features (Settings, CoA, JEs, GST workflow, Financial Reports UI) remain stable.

**Confirmation of "Common Features" Completion (relative to recent plans):**

*   **Basic Customer Management Module**:
    *   Backend (DTOs, Service, Manager, Core Integration): **Complete**.
    *   Frontend UI (TableModel, Dialog, Widget for List/Add/Edit/Toggle Active): **Implemented**.
    *   The user can now navigate to the "Customers" tab, see a (likely empty) list, add new customers, edit them, and toggle their active status. The backend logic for validation and data persistence is in place.
*   **Journal Entry Module**: Full lifecycle (List, Add, Edit Draft, View, Post, Reverse) is implemented and was tested as stable.
*   **Settings Module**: Company Info and Fiscal Year/Period management (add new year + auto-generate periods) is implemented.
*   **Reports Module**:
    *   GST F5 Data Preparation & Finalization (Save Draft, Finalize with JE settlement) UI and backend are implemented.
    *   Financial Statements (BS, P&L, TB, GL) UI for selection, parameter input, on-screen HTML view, and PDF/Excel export is implemented.
*   **Core System**: Async/Qt bridge, config, DB management, security foundation, audit logging (with user context) are functional.

**What "common features" might still be considered "gaps" based on a typical accounting app, even if MVP level?**
*   **Vendor Management**: The direct counterpart to Customer Management. The pattern is now set.
*   **Product/Service Management**: For items used in invoices.
*   **Sales/Purchase Invoicing**: These are very core. Currently, JEs are general.
*   **Banking**: Basic bank account setup and transaction entry (not full reconciliation yet).
*   **User/Role Management UI**: Backend exists, UI is missing.

**Current Project Status Recap:**

*   **Core Architecture**: Stable.
*   **Database & ORM**: Comprehensive and functional.
*   **Settings UI**: Company settings and Fiscal Year/Period management functional.
*   **Chart of Accounts UI**: Functional.
*   **Journal Entries UI & Backend**: Substantially complete and functional.
*   **GST Functionality**:
    *   Backend: Data aggregation and finalization logic in `GSTManager` is implemented.
    *   UI: UI in `ReportsWidget` to prepare, view, save draft, and finalize GST returns.
*   **Financial Reports UI**: UI in `ReportsWidget` to select, generate, view on-screen, and export standard financial reports (BS, P&L, TB, **General Ledger**).
*   **Customer Management (Backend)**: DTOs, Service, Manager, and `ApplicationCore` integration are complete.
*   **Customer Management (Frontend - UI Foundation)**: `CustomerTableModel` and `CustomerDialog` are created. `CustomersWidget` has been enhanced from a stub to include a table, toolbar, and basic filter UI, with slots connected to manager methods.
*   **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: All identified issues (audit context, sequence generation, icon loading, Pydantic dependencies) have been addressed.

**Next Step Identification:**

The user asks to "proceed with the next step in your plan."
The last major plan was "Enhancement Execution Plan: Basic Customer Management Module".
*   **Phase A: Backend for Customer Management (Completed)**
*   **Phase B: Frontend UI for Customer Management (Current Focus)**
    *   B1. Create `CustomerTableModel` (Done).
    *   B2. Create `CustomerDialog` (Done).
    *   B3. Enhance `CustomersWidget` (from stub to functional) (Done - file `app/ui/customers/customers_widget.py` was generated in the previous step).

The next logical step is to **ensure all necessary `__init__.py` files are updated to correctly export the new Customer UI components, and that `MainWindow` properly instantiates and displays `CustomersWidget`.** Then, it would be **Phase 4: Testing and Verification** for the Customer module.

---
**Next Steps (Implicitly Phase 4 for Customers):**

The application should now be ready for thorough testing of the Customer Management functionality:
*   Navigating to the "Customers" tab.
*   Verifying the (initially empty) customer list loads.
*   Using the "Add Customer" action:
    *   Testing the `CustomerDialog` opens.
    *   Testing population of Currency and A/R Account combo boxes.
    *   Testing data entry and validation (both client-side if any, and server-side via manager).
    *   Saving a new customer.
*   Verifying the new customer appears in the `CustomersWidget` table.
*   Using the "Edit Customer" action:
    *   Selecting a customer and launching the `CustomerDialog`.
    *   Verifying fields are pre-populated correctly.
    *   Modifying data and saving.
*   Verifying changes are reflected in the table.
*   Using the "Toggle Active Status" action:
    *   Selecting a customer.
    *   Confirming the action.
    *   Verifying the "Active" status changes in the table and database.
*   Testing the search/filter functionality in `CustomersWidget`.
*   Checking the `business.customers` table in the PostgreSQL database to confirm data persistence.
*   Checking the `audit.audit_log` and `audit.data_change_history` tables for customer creation/update/status change entries, ensuring the `user_id` is correctly logged.

This thorough testing will confirm the successful implementation of the basic Customer Management module.
