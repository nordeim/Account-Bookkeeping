**Current Project Status Recap:**

*   **Basic Product/Service Management Module (Backend & Frontend UI)**:
    *   Phase A (Backend): Complete.
    *   Phase B (Frontend):
        *   B1. `ProductTableModel` (Created).
        *   B2. `ProductDialog` (Created).
        *   B3. `ProductsWidget` (Enhanced from stub, integrated, and `NameError` fixed).
    *   The module is now structurally complete and should be testable.
*   All previously implemented features (Customer/Vendor Management, Settings, CoA, JEs, GST, Financial Reports) remain stable.

**Next Step Identification:**

The user says "please continue," implying we should proceed with the next logical step based on the established plan and roadmap.

The "Current Focus / Short-term" roadmap items from the last `README.md` update were:
1.  **Product/Service Management UI**: Implement basic UI (List, Add, Edit, Toggle Active) for products and services, using the established backend. *(This is now complete).*
2.  **Refine Reporting**: Improve on-screen display of financial reports (e.g., explore `QTableView` for better structure than HTML in `QTextEdit` for some reports).
3.  **User and Role Management UI**: Add UI in Settings for managing users, roles, and permissions.

With Product/Service Management UI basics in place, we have two main directions from the short-term roadmap: improving existing report displays or adding User/Role Management UI.

*   **Refine Reporting (e.g., `QTableView` for reports)**:
    *   **Pros**: Improves usability of already functional reporting features. `QTableView` can offer sorting, better column alignment, and potentially copying data.
    *   **Cons**: Can be complex to create a generic `QTableView` structure that adapts well to different report layouts (BS, P&L, TB, GL all have different column needs and hierarchical structures). Might involve creating custom table models for each report type or a very flexible generic one.
*   **User and Role Management UI**:
    *   **Pros**: Adds a critical administrative feature. The backend models (`User`, `Role`, `Permission`) and `SecurityManager` logic (like `has_permission`) are already in place, providing a good foundation. This would likely be a new section/tab in the `SettingsWidget`.
    *   **Cons**: Requires new UI dialogs for User creation/editing (including role assignment) and Role creation/editing (including permission assignment).

**Decision for this Turn:**
Implementing the **User and Role Management UI** seems like a more impactful next step in terms of adding new "core feature set" capabilities, especially since the backend for it is substantially there. Refining report display is important but more of a UX enhancement.

**Plan for this Turn: Implement Basic User and Role Management UI (in Settings)**

This will be a multi-part UI implementation. For this turn, let's focus on:
1.  **Listing Users** in the `SettingsWidget`.
2.  **Dialog for Adding/Editing Users** (basic fields: username, full name, email, active status, password change). Role assignment can be a subsequent step within this dialog or a separate management screen for roles.
3.  **Backend Manager methods** in `SecurityManager` (or a new `UserManager`) to support these UI operations if existing ones are not sufficient (e.g., list users, update user details).

**Current Project Status Recap:**

*   **Basic Vendor Management Module (Backend & Frontend UI)**: Complete and stable at startup. Functional testing is the next step for this specific module.
*   **Basic Customer Management Module (Backend & Frontend UI)**: Complete and stable.
*   All previously implemented core accounting features (Settings, CoA, JEs, GST workflow, Financial Reports UI) remain stable.

---
**Confirmation of "Common Features" Completion (relative to recent plans):**

*   **Basic Customer Management Module**:
    *   Backend (DTOs, Service, Manager, Core Integration): **Complete**.
    *   Frontend UI (TableModel, Dialog, Widget for List/Add/Edit/Toggle Active): **Implemented**.
    *   The user can now navigate to the "Customers" tab, see a (likely empty) list, add new customers, edit them, and toggle their active status. The backend logic for validation and data persistence is in place.
*   **Journal Entry Module**: Full lifecycle (List, Add, Edit Draft, View, Post, Reverse) is implemented and was tested as stable.
*   **Settings Module**: Company Info and Fiscal Year/Period management (add new year + auto-generate periods) is implemented.
*   **Reports Module**:
    *   GST F5 Data Preparation & Finalization (Save Draft, Finalize with JE settlement) UI and backend are implemented.
    *   Financial Statements (BS, P&L, TB, GL) UI for selection, parameter input, on-screen HTML view, and PDF/Excel export is implemented.
*   **Core System**: Async/Qt bridge, config, DB management, security foundation, audit logging (with user context) are functional.

**What "common features" might still be considered "gaps" based on a typical accounting app, even if MVP level?**
*   **Vendor Management**: The direct counterpart to Customer Management. The pattern is now set.
*   **Product/Service Management**: For items used in invoices.
*   **Sales/Purchase Invoicing**: These are very core. Currently, JEs are general.
*   **Banking**: Basic bank account setup and transaction entry (not full reconciliation yet).
*   **User/Role Management UI**: Backend exists, UI is missing.

**Current Project Status Recap:**

*   **Core Architecture**: Stable.
*   **Database & ORM**: Comprehensive and functional.
*   **Settings UI**: Company settings and Fiscal Year/Period management functional.
*   **Chart of Accounts UI**: Functional.
*   **Journal Entries UI & Backend**: Substantially complete and functional.
*   **GST Functionality**:
    *   Backend: Data aggregation and finalization logic in `GSTManager` is implemented.
    *   UI: UI in `ReportsWidget` to prepare, view, save draft, and finalize GST returns.
*   **Financial Reports UI**: UI in `ReportsWidget` to select, generate, view on-screen, and export standard financial reports (BS, P&L, TB, **General Ledger**).
*   **Customer Management (Backend)**: DTOs, Service, Manager, and `ApplicationCore` integration are complete.
*   **Customer Management (Frontend - UI Foundation)**: `CustomerTableModel` and `CustomerDialog` are created. `CustomersWidget` has been enhanced from a stub to include a table, toolbar, and basic filter UI, with slots connected to manager methods.
*   **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: All identified issues (audit context, sequence generation, icon loading, Pydantic dependencies) have been addressed.

**Next Step Identification:**

The user asks to "proceed with the next step in your plan."
The last major plan was "Enhancement Execution Plan: Basic Customer Management Module".
*   **Phase A: Backend for Customer Management (Completed)**
*   **Phase B: Frontend UI for Customer Management (Current Focus)**
    *   B1. Create `CustomerTableModel` (Done).
    *   B2. Create `CustomerDialog` (Done).
    *   B3. Enhance `CustomersWidget` (from stub to functional) (Done - file `app/ui/customers/customers_widget.py` was generated in the previous step).

The next logical step is to **ensure all necessary `__init__.py` files are updated to correctly export the new Customer UI components, and that `MainWindow` properly instantiates and displays `CustomersWidget`.** Then, it would be **Phase 4: Testing and Verification** for the Customer module.

---
**Next Steps (Implicitly Phase 4 for Customers):**

The application should now be ready for thorough testing of the Customer Management functionality:
*   Navigating to the "Customers" tab.
*   Verifying the (initially empty) customer list loads.
*   Using the "Add Customer" action:
    *   Testing the `CustomerDialog` opens.
    *   Testing population of Currency and A/R Account combo boxes.
    *   Testing data entry and validation (both client-side if any, and server-side via manager).
    *   Saving a new customer.
*   Verifying the new customer appears in the `CustomersWidget` table.
*   Using the "Edit Customer" action:
    *   Selecting a customer and launching the `CustomerDialog`.
    *   Verifying fields are pre-populated correctly.
    *   Modifying data and saving.
*   Verifying changes are reflected in the table.
*   Using the "Toggle Active Status" action:
    *   Selecting a customer.
    *   Confirming the action.
    *   Verifying the "Active" status changes in the table and database.
*   Testing the search/filter functionality in `CustomersWidget`.
*   Checking the `business.customers` table in the PostgreSQL database to confirm data persistence.
*   Checking the `audit.audit_log` and `audit.data_change_history` tables for customer creation/update/status change entries, ensuring the `user_id` is correctly logged.

This thorough testing will confirm the successful implementation of the basic Customer Management module.
