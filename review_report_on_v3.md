The application is launching and shutting down cleanly yet again! This is fantastic. It means the UI enhancements for GST F5 Return Finalization in `ReportsWidget` have been integrated successfully without introducing startup/shutdown regressions.

**Current Project Status Recap:**

*   **Core Architecture**: Stable.
*   **Database & ORM**: Comprehensive and functional.
*   **Settings UI**: Company settings and Fiscal Year/Period management functional.
*   **Chart of Accounts UI**: Functional.
*   **Journal Entries UI & Backend**: Substantially complete and functional.
*   **GST Functionality**:
    *   Backend: Data aggregation and finalization (with JE settlement) logic in `GSTManager` is implemented.
    *   UI: UI in `ReportsWidget` to prepare, view, save draft, and finalize GST returns.
*   **Financial Reports UI**: UI in `ReportsWidget` to select, generate, view on-screen, and export standard financial reports (BS, P&L, TB).
*   **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Audit trigger context, sequence generation, icon loading are addressed.

**Next Step Identification - Closing Gaps / Commonly Needed Features:**

Referring to TDS v4's "Future Considerations / Missing Pieces" and the overall project goals, and considering the current state:

1.  **Testing and Verification (from original plan - Phase 4)**: With significant features like Journal Entries, GST workflow, and Financial Reports UI now in place, dedicated testing is overdue.
2.  **Basic UI for "Stubbed" Business Modules (Customers, Vendors, Products)**: This remains a large area to make the app more comprehensive.
3.  **Refining On-Screen Report Display**: For Financial Reports.
4.  **Sequence Generation Strategy**: While addressed by making `SequenceGenerator` use the DB function if no prefix override, the Python fallback still exists. A more consistent approach could be to always use the DB function, perhaps modifying it to accept an optional prefix. This is a minor refinement.
5.  **User and Role Management UI**: The backend (`SecurityManager`, DB tables) supports this, but there's no UI in Settings.

**Prioritization for this Turn:**

Given that several major features have been implemented, **it's prudent to dedicate this turn to Phase 4: Testing and Verification from the original "Enhancement Execution Plan (v1)"**. While no new code files might be generated (unless bugs are found and fixed), this step is crucial for stability and confirming the implemented features work as intended.

The user's request is to "proceed with the next step in your plan". Although I don't generate test scripts, I can outline a detailed manual testing plan. This aligns with the "rigorous and meticulous approach" and helps ensure quality before adding more new features.

If the user prefers to continue with feature development, the next logical feature would be starting one of the **Business Modules**, like **Customer Management**. However, testing the current state is a very good practice.

For this turn, I will assume the "next step" implies ensuring the quality and correctness of what's been built so far, which means outlining a testing plan. If the user wants to jump to another feature immediately, they can specify.

**Plan for this Turn: Outline Manual Testing Plan for Implemented Features**

**Objective:** Define a set of manual test cases to verify the functionality of recently implemented features: Settings (Company, Fiscal Years), Chart of Accounts, Journal Entries (full lifecycle), GST F5 Preparation & Finalization, and Financial Reports viewing/export.
