Of course. I will now meticulously review the provided `diff` output for the file `app/ui/banking/csv_import_config_dialog.py`.

### **Diff Validation: `app/ui/banking/csv_import_config_dialog.py`**

**Objective:** Validate that the changes made to the CSV import dialog correctly implement the new error handling workflow (launching a detailed error dialog) without omitting any original features.

1.  **Line 1-7 (Imports):**
    *   **Change:**
        *   `typing.List` was added.
        *   `json_helpers.json_converter` was removed.
        *   `CSVImportErrorData` and `CSVImportErrorsDialog` were added.
    *   **Reason:** `List` is needed for the `detailed_errors` type hint. `json_converter` is no longer needed as the result is handled more intelligently. The new DTO and Dialog are required for the new feature.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** The import changes directly support the new error handling mechanism.

2.  **Line 13 & 16-22 (Class Definition & Constants):**
    *   **Change:** The class definition and constant declarations were condensed to single lines.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** This is a purely cosmetic change to make the code more compact and does not alter functionality.

3.  **Line 24-206 (Method `__init__`, `_init_ui`, `_connect_signals`, `_browse_file`, `_on_has_header_changed`, `_update_ui_for_column_type`, `_get_column_specifier`, `_collect_config_and_import`):**
    *   **Change:** The `diff` shows a large deletion block followed by a large addition block. This indicates that the methods were rewritten or significantly refactored, but a line-by-line comparison of the deleted and added blocks shows that the code's logic and structure are **identical**. The only difference is formatting (e.g., line breaks, spacing).
    *   **Validation:** **Correct and Harmless.** The core logic for initializing the UI, connecting signals, browsing files, and collecting the configuration data from the user remains exactly the same. No features have been lost. The diff is just showing a reformatting of the existing code.

4.  **Line 208 (`_handle_import_result_slot`):** This is the most critical section to review.

    *   **Original Code (deleted lines):**
        ```python
        try:
            result: Result[Dict[str, int]] = future_arg.result()
            if result.is_success and result.value:
                summary = result.value
                summary_msg = (
                    f"Import Complete for Bank Account ID: {self.bank_account_id}\n"
                    f"Total Rows Processed: {summary.get('total_rows_in_file', 0)}\n"
                    f"Successfully Imported: {summary.get('imported_count', 0)}\n"
                    f"Skipped (Duplicates): {summary.get('skipped_duplicates_count', 0)}\n"
                    f"Failed (Errors): {summary.get('failed_rows_count', 0)}"
                )
                QMessageBox.information(self, "Import Result", summary_msg)
                self.statement_imported.emit(summary) 
                self.accept()
            else:
                QMessageBox.warning(self, "Import Failed", f"Failed to import statement:\n{', '.join(result.errors)}")
        except Exception as e:
            # ...
        ```

    *   **New Code (added lines):**
        ```python
        try:
            result: Result[Dict[str, Any]] = future_arg.result()
            if result.is_success and result.value:
                summary = result.value
                detailed_errors = summary.get("detailed_errors", [])
                
                summary_msg_parts = [ # ... builds summary message parts ... ]
                
                if detailed_errors:
                    error_dialog = CSVImportErrorsDialog(detailed_errors, self)
                    error_dialog.exec()
                    QMessageBox.warning(self, "Import Complete with Errors", "\n".join(summary_msg_parts))
                else:
                    QMessageBox.information(self, "Import Successful", "\n".join(summary_msg_parts))
                
                self.statement_imported.emit(summary) 
                self.accept()
            else:
                # ... same error handling ...
        except Exception as e:
            # ... same exception handling ...
        ```
    *   **Analysis of Change:**
        1.  The type hint for the result was correctly changed from `Result[Dict[str, int]]` to `Result[Dict[str, Any]]` to accommodate the new list of error DTOs.
        2.  The code now extracts `detailed_errors` from the result dictionary.
        3.  The summary message is now built as a list of strings (`summary_msg_parts`), which is functionally equivalent but more readable. It also correctly includes the `zero_amount_skipped_count`.
        4.  **The core logic change is here:** An `if detailed_errors:` block was added. If errors exist, it now instantiates and shows the new `CSVImportErrorsDialog`. After the user closes the error dialog, it shows a `QMessageBox.warning` with the summary.
        5.  If there are no errors, it proceeds as before, showing a `QMessageBox.information` with the summary.
        6.  The `statement_imported.emit(summary)` and `self.accept()` calls are preserved in both paths, ensuring the main application flow continues correctly after the import attempt.

    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** This is a perfect implementation of the planned feature. The logic correctly handles both success and failure cases, and a new branch was added to specifically handle cases with partial success (some rows imported, some failed). It correctly uses the new `CSVImportErrorsDialog`.

### Final Conclusion

The `diff` has been meticulously reviewed. The changes are correct, align perfectly with the execution plan, and successfully implement the enhanced error reporting feature for the CSV import dialog. No existing functionality has been omitted or altered accidentally. The code is validated and ready.
