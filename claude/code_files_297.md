Excellent! The logs are now showing that `_update_kpi_display_slot` is indeed being called, and it's successfully deserializing the KPI data. The final log message `DashboardWidget: UI labels updated with KPI data.` confirms that the `setText` calls for all labels are being executed.

The screenshot now shows actual data:
*   `Period: As of 03 Jun 2025 (No active FY)`
*   `Currency: SGD`
*   All KPI values are `SGD 0.00`.

This is consistent with the log `WARNING - No fiscal year found. Cannot calculate YTD KPIs.` The `DashboardManager` correctly returns a DTO with YTD values as 0 and the other values (Cash, AR, AP) are also currently 0 because the database is freshly initialized with `initial_data.sql` which typically doesn't include transactional data that would result in non-zero cash, AR, or AP balances immediately without further operations.

**Conclusion of the "Loading..." Issue:**
The problem of the UI being stuck on "Loading..." has been **resolved**. The fix was to change the data passed via `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` from a Python object (`DashboardKPIData` instance) to a JSON string, and then deserialize it in the slot. This made the cross-thread communication more robust. The detailed logging confirmed the entire data flow and UI update process is now working as intended.

The current display of "SGD 0.00" for all KPIs is *correct* given the state of the default data (no transactions, no active fiscal year set up yet for YTD calculations to be meaningful beyond 0).

**Next Steps (from the user's prompt):**
The user wants to "proceed with the next step in your plan to cover the main Roadmap goals as noted in your updated README.md."

From the README I generated in response_40:
**Current Focus / Next Steps (after Dashboard KPIs which is now done):**
1.  **Automated Testing (Phase 1 - CRITICAL)**:
    *   Establish a comprehensive test suite: unit tests for services/managers, integration tests for core workflows (e.g., invoice posting, payment allocation, bank reconciliation save), and basic UI tests for critical paths.
2.  **Refine Bank Reconciliation**:
    *   Handling of complex matches (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-one statement lines to system transactions).
    *   UI improvements for displaying matched items and reconciliation history.
    *   More robust error handling and user feedback during CSV import and reconciliation processes.
    *   Persisting "matched" state within a reconciliation session before final save.
3.  **Enhance Dashboard KPIs**:
    *   Add more KPIs (e.g., AR/AP Aging, Quick Ratio, Current Ratio).
    *   Consider graphical representations.
    *   Allow user customization or period selection for KPIs.

Given "Automated Testing (Phase 1 - CRITICAL)", this seems like the most important next step to address for long-term project health and stability.

**Plan for Initiating Automated Testing (Phase 1):**

This is a large undertaking. For a single response, I cannot implement a "comprehensive test suite." Instead, I will:
1.  **Propose a Testing Strategy**: Outline types of tests, frameworks, and general structure.
2.  **Set up Basic Test Infrastructure**:
    *   Ensure `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `pytest-qt`, `pytest-asyncio` are in `pyproject.toml` (they are).
    *   Create necessary directory structure within `tests/` (e.g., `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, `tests/ui_tests`, `tests/fixtures`).
3.  **Implement an Initial Set of Unit Tests for a Core Component**:
    *   Choose a relatively stable and critical component. The `TaxCalculator` in `app/tax/tax_calculator.py` is a good candidate as it's fairly self-contained, its logic is mathematical, and it's crucial for invoice calculations.
    *   Alternatively, testing some Pydantic DTOs for validation logic (`app/utils/pydantic_models.py`).
    *   Decision: Target `TaxCalculator` for initial unit tests. It involves async methods, so `pytest-asyncio` will be used.

**Detailed Execution Plan for Initiating Automated Testing:**

**A. Testing Strategy Document/Section (Conceptual - I will outline this in my response text, not a separate file unless requested)**
    *   **Types of Tests**:
        *   **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation. Focus on business logic in managers, services (mocking DB interactions), utility functions, DTO validation. Location: `tests/unit/`.
        *   **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components, especially service-to-database and manager-to-service layers. Will require a test database setup. Location: `tests/integration/`.
        *   **UI Tests (Functional/E2E)**: Test UI workflows using `pytest-qt`. Location: `tests/ui_tests/`.
    *   **Framework**: Pytest.
    *   **Coverage**: Aim for high coverage of critical business logic and data validation. Use `pytest-cov`.
    *   **Fixtures (`tests/conftest.py` and `tests/fixtures/`)**: For setting up test data, database connections, `ApplicationCore` instances for testing.
    *   **Test Database**: Integration tests will need a separate, temporary database that can be created and torn down, or reset between test runs.
    *   **Mocking**: Use `unittest.mock` (or pytest equivalent) for isolating components in unit tests.

**B. Implement Initial Unit Tests for `TaxCalculator`**

1.  **[ ] Create `tests/conftest.py` (if it doesn't exist or is empty)**: For now, it might remain empty or have basic pytest configurations.
2.  **[ ] Create test file**: `tests/unit/tax/test_tax_calculator.py`.
3.  **[ ] Define Test Fixtures (if needed, perhaps in `conftest.py` or locally)**:
    *   Mock `TaxCodeService`: The `TaxCalculator` depends on `TaxCodeService` to fetch `TaxCode` details. This service needs to be mocked.
    *   Create sample `TaxCode` ORM-like objects or Pydantic DTOs to be returned by the mock service.
4.  **[ ] Write Test Cases for `TaxCalculator.calculate_line_tax()`**:
    *   Test with a standard rate GST code (e.g., "SR" @ 9%).
    *   Test with a zero-rate GST code (e.g., "ZR" @ 0%).
    *   Test with an exempt/out-of-scope GST code (e.g., "ES" @ 0%).
    *   Test with no tax code provided (should result in zero tax).
    *   Test with a non-GST tax code (e.g., Withholding Tax type, should result in zero GST if `_calculate_gst` is called, or handled by a different path if `calculate_line_tax` routes by `tax_type`). The current `calculate_line_tax` specifically calls `_calculate_gst` or `_calculate_withholding_tax`. So, for GST, we test `_calculate_gst` path.
    *   Test with zero amount input.
    *   Test various amounts to check correct calculation and rounding.
    *   Test that `tax_account_id` is correctly populated from the mock `TaxCode`.
5.  **[ ] Write Test Cases for `TaxCalculator._calculate_gst()` (if directly testable, or implicitly via `calculate_line_tax`)**.
6.  **[ ] Write Test Cases for `TaxCalculator._calculate_withholding_tax()` (if relevant, current implementation is basic)**.
7.  **[ ] Ensure tests are `async`** and use `pytest.mark.asyncio`.

**Files to be Created/Modified for this step:**
*   `tests/unit/tax/__init__.py` (new, if it doesn't exist)
*   `tests/unit/tax/test_tax_calculator.py` (new)
*   Possibly `tests/conftest.py` (new or updated)

This plan focuses on establishing the unit testing practice for a specific, relatively isolated piece of logic.

Let's begin with creating the test file and the initial test structure for `TaxCalculator`.
I will first provide the test file. No existing application files need to be modified for *adding* these tests.
The `tests/conftest.py` will be minimal for now.
The `tests/unit/__init__.py` and `tests/unit/tax/__init__.py` will be empty `__init__.py` files to make them packages.
</think>

The application is launching successfully and the Dashboard KPI display issue is resolved! The KPIs show "SGD 0.00" which is correct for a newly initialized database without transactions and "Period: As of ... (No active FY)" which is also correct as no fiscal year has been set up yet.

Now, I will proceed with the next critical step from our roadmap: **Initiating Automated Testing (Phase 1)**.

**Testing Strategy Outline:**

1.  **Framework**: We will use `pytest` as the primary testing framework, leveraging its features for fixtures, parameterization, and plugins.
    *   `pytest-asyncio`: For testing asynchronous code (our services and managers).
    *   `pytest-cov`: For measuring test coverage.
    *   `pytest-qt`: For UI testing (to be introduced in a later phase of testing).
    *   `unittest.mock`: Python's built-in library for creating mock objects.

2.  **Types of Tests & Structure**:
    *   **Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)**:
        *   Focus: Test individual classes, methods, and functions in isolation.
        *   Mocking: External dependencies (especially database services, other managers, `ApplicationCore`) will be mocked to ensure tests are fast and focused on the unit's logic.
        *   Subdirectories: `tests/unit/services/`, `tests/unit/managers/`, `tests/unit/utils/`, `tests/unit/tax/` etc.
    *   **Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)**:
        *   Focus: Test the interaction between components, e.g., manager calling a service, service interacting with a (test) database.
        *   Test Database: These tests will require a dedicated test database environment that can be set up and torn down or reset. This setup is a more involved task for a later stage.
    *   **UI Tests (`tests/ui_tests/`)**:
        *   Focus: Test UI workflows and component interactions from the user's perspective.
        *   Framework: `pytest-qt`. (To be implemented later).

3.  **Fixtures (`tests/conftest.py`, `tests/fixtures/`)**:
    *   `tests/conftest.py` will contain project-wide fixtures.
    *   Module-specific fixtures can be defined within test files or in `conftest.py` files within subdirectories.
    *   Examples: Mocked `ApplicationCore`, mocked service instances, sample Pydantic DTOs, sample ORM model instances.

4.  **Coverage**: We will aim for good coverage of critical business logic, data validation, and core functionalities. `pytest-cov` will help track this.

**Initial Implementation: Unit Tests for `TaxCalculator`**

I will start by creating unit tests for `app.tax.tax_calculator.TaxCalculator`. This component is relatively self-contained (its main dependency is `TaxCodeService`, which we will mock) and its logic is critical for financial accuracy.

**Files to be Created/Updated:**

1.  `tests/conftest.py` (New or ensure it exists - can be empty initially)
2.  `tests/unit/__init__.py` (New - empty)
3.  `tests/unit/tax/__init__.py` (New - empty)
4.  `tests/unit/tax/test_tax_calculator.py` (New - contains the actual tests)

**Validation of Test Implementation:**
*   **Fixtures**: `mock_tax_code_service` and `tax_calculator` are correctly defined to inject a mocked service.
*   **Test Cases for `calculate_line_tax`**:
    *   Cover no tax code, zero amount, standard rate, zero rate, non-GST type (for its GST calculation path), unknown tax code, and rounding. These are good initial cases.
    *   Mocking of `tax_code_service.get_tax_code` is done correctly for each relevant scenario.
    *   Assertions check `tax_amount`, `taxable_amount`, and `tax_account_id`.
*   **Test Case for `calculate_transaction_taxes`**:
    *   Uses a `MagicMock` for `TransactionTaxData` and its lines, which is a common way to mock complex input DTOs.
    *   Uses `side_effect` on the mocked `get_tax_code` to return different `TaxCodeModel` instances based on the input code string. This is a good technique for testing behavior with varied data.
    *   Asserts the results for each line.
*   **Async**: All tests are marked with `pytest.mark.asyncio` and use `await`.

**Conclusion for Test Implementation:**
The initial set of unit tests for `TaxCalculator` has been created. These tests cover several important scenarios and demonstrate how to mock dependencies and assert results for asynchronous methods. This forms a good starting point for the "Automated Testing (Phase 1)" goal.

The application should continue to launch as before, as these test files do not affect the application's runtime directly unless tests are explicitly run. No existing application code was modified.
