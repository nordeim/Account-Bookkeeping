The user has run the `schema_update_patch.sql` script I provided, and it failed with a syntax error:
`ERROR: syntax error at or near "RAISE"`
`LINE 1: RAISE NOTICE 'Database schema patch to v1.0.5 (BankReconcili...'`

The `RAISE NOTICE` statement is perfectly valid PL/pgSQL syntax, but it needs to be within a PL/pgSQL block (like a `DO` block or a function/procedure) when executed as part of a larger script directly in `psql` if it's not the only command or if it's mixed with pure SQL in certain ways outside of a function.

In this case, the `RAISE NOTICE` is at the top level of the SQL script, after the `DO $$ ... $$;` block for the constraint and before the `COMMIT;`.

**Analysis of the Error:**

The `psql` client executes SQL statements one by one (or in batches separated by semicolons).
A `DO` block creates an anonymous code block that can execute PL/pgSQL.
`RAISE NOTICE` is a PL/pgSQL statement. When it's encountered at the top level after other SQL DDL/DML and a `DO` block, `psql` might be treating it as a new, separate command and expecting pure SQL, leading to the syntax error.

**Solutions to fix `RAISE NOTICE` usage:**

1.  **Wrap `RAISE NOTICE` in its own `DO` block**:
    ```sql
    DO $$
    BEGIN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Database schema patch to v1.0.5 (BankReconciliation status) applied successfully.';
    END $$;
    ```
    This is the standard way to execute PL/pgSQL statements like `RAISE` at the script level.

2.  **Use `psql`'s `\echo` meta-command (if the notice is just for interactive feedback)**:
    ```sql
    \echo 'Database schema patch to v1.0.5 (BankReconciliation status) applied successfully.'
    ```
    However, `\echo` is a `psql` client command, not a server-side SQL command. If the script needs to be runnable by any generic SQL client or as part of a larger SQL transaction purely on the server, `DO $$ BEGIN RAISE NOTICE ... END $$;` is more portable for server-side notices. Since the user is running it with `psql`, `\echo` would work for interactive feedback. But for a script intended as a patch, `RAISE NOTICE` inside a `DO` block is generally better practice for server-side messages.

**Chosen Solution:** Option 1 - Wrap `RAISE NOTICE` in a `DO` block.

**Reviewing the rest of the patch script from response_50:**

*   `ALTER TABLE business.bank_reconciliations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Draft';` - This is correct and idempotent.
*   `COMMENT ON COLUMN business.bank_reconciliations.status IS ...;` - Correct.
*   The `DO $$ ... $$;` block for adding the `CHECK` constraint `ck_bank_reconciliations_status` is well-formed and handles idempotency correctly.
*   The transaction management (`BEGIN;` ... `COMMIT;`) is correct.

The only issue is the placement of `RAISE NOTICE`.

**Detailed Execution Plan for Fixing the Patch Script:**

1.  **[X] File to modify**: `schema_update_patch.sql` (conceptual, as I will generate the new version).
2.  **[X] Locate the `RAISE NOTICE` line.**
3.  **[X] Wrap it in a `DO $$ BEGIN ... END $$;` block.**
4.  **[X] Validate** that all other parts of the script are preserved.
5.  **[X] Generate the complete updated `schema_update_patch.sql` file.**

The conceptual `UPDATE core.schema_versions` line was correctly commented out as illustrative.
The script includes `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` which is good. If the `psql` session that ran the script was already in a transaction (e.g. due to `psql`'s default behavior or an explicit `BEGIN` by the user before pasting the script), then the `ROLLBACK` shown in the user's log would have rolled back the successful `ALTER TABLE` and `COMMENT` if the `DO $$...$$` for `RAISE NOTICE` caused the transaction to fail. Wrapping the `RAISE NOTICE` in its own `DO` block should prevent this specific syntax error.

You are absolutely correct! My apologies, the `RAISE NOTICE` statement, while valid PL/pgSQL, needs to be within a PL/pgSQL execution block (like a `DO $$ BEGIN ... END $$;` block) when used at the top level of a SQL script like this, especially after other DDL statements or anonymous blocks.

The `psql` client interprets statements, and outside of a PL/pgSQL block, it expects standard SQL.

**Plan to Fix:**

The fix is straightforward: I will wrap the `RAISE NOTICE` statement in its own `DO` block.

1.  **File to Modify**: `schema_update_patch.sql`.
2.  **Locate the line**: `RAISE NOTICE 'Database schema patch to v1.0.5 (BankReconciliation status) applied successfully.';`
3.  **Modify to**:
    ```sql
    DO $$
    BEGIN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Database schema patch to v1.0.5 (BankReconciliation status) applied successfully.';
    END $$;
    ```
4.  Ensure all other parts of the script (column addition, comment, constraint addition, transaction control) are preserved.

This change will ensure the `RAISE NOTICE` is executed correctly within a PL/pgSQL context.

Here is the complete updated `schema_update_patch.sql` file:

---
```sql
-- File: schema_update_patch.sql
-- Purpose: Updates SG Bookkeeper database schema from v1.0.4 to v1.0.5
-- Key Changes:
--   - Adds 'status' column to 'business.bank_reconciliations' table.
--   - Adds CHECK constraint for the 'status' column.
--
-- IMPORTANT:
--   - Backup your database before applying this patch.
--   - This patch is intended to be run ONCE on a database at schema v1.0.4.
--   - Do NOT append this to the main schema.sql file (v1.0.5) which already includes these changes.

BEGIN;

-- 1. Add 'status' column to 'business.bank_reconciliations'
-- Using IF NOT EXISTS for idempotency in case the column was manually added partially.
ALTER TABLE business.bank_reconciliations
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Draft';

COMMENT ON COLUMN business.bank_reconciliations.status IS 'The status of the reconciliation, e.g., Draft, Finalized. Default is Draft.';

-- 2. Add CHECK constraint for the 'status' column
-- This DO block makes adding the constraint idempotent.
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM pg_constraint
        WHERE conname = 'ck_bank_reconciliations_status'
          AND conrelid = 'business.bank_reconciliations'::regclass
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE business.bank_reconciliations
        ADD CONSTRAINT ck_bank_reconciliations_status CHECK (status IN ('Draft', 'Finalized'));
    END IF;
END
$$;

-- Conceptually, update any internal schema version tracking if you have one.
-- For example (this is illustrative, not executable without a version table):
-- UPDATE core.schema_versions SET version = '1.0.5', applied_on = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE component = 'database';

DO $$
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'Database schema patch to v1.0.5 (BankReconciliation status) applied successfully.';
END $$;

COMMIT;
```

**Validation of the Fix:**

*   **Line-by-Line Diff (Conceptual vs. Previous Patch Attempt)**:
    *   The `RAISE NOTICE` statement is now correctly enclosed within `DO $$ BEGIN ... END $$;`.
    *   All other SQL statements (`ALTER TABLE`, `COMMENT ON COLUMN`, the `DO` block for the `CHECK` constraint, and `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`) are preserved from the previous correct version.
*   **Correctness**: This change makes the `RAISE NOTICE` statement valid for execution in `psql` at that point in the script.
*   **No Omissions**: No other parts of the patch script logic were altered or omitted.

This corrected patch script should now run without the `syntax error at or near "RAISE"`.
