Okay, I have meticulously reviewed the `diff` output for `app/reporting/report_engine.py` which details the changes for enhancing Trial Balance exports and prepares for General Ledger export enhancements.

**Overall Assessment:**

The changes are **valid and correctly implement enhanced PDF and Excel export functionality for the Trial Balance report.** The dispatcher logic in `export_report` has been updated appropriately. The groundwork and fallbacks for General Ledger are also in place. No original features or the existing enhanced BS/P&L export functionalities appear to be lost or negatively impacted. The code structure for report generation is becoming more consistent and refined.

**Detailed Review of Changes (Diff Analysis):**

1.  **File Header:**
    *   `-# File: app/reporting/report_engine.py`
    *   `+# app/reporting/report_engine.py`
    *   **Validation**: Trivial comment change. Valid.

2.  **`_setup_custom_styles()` Method:**
    *   `self.styles.add(ParagraphStyle(name='TableHeader', parent=self.styles['Normal'], fontName='Helvetica-Bold', alignment=TA_CENTER))`
        changed to
        `self.styles.add(ParagraphStyle(name='TableHeader', parent=self.styles['Normal'], fontName='Helvetica-Bold', alignment=TA_CENTER, textColor=colors.whitesmoke))`
    *   `+        self.styles.add(ParagraphStyle(name='NormalRight', parent=self.styles['Normal'], alignment=TA_RIGHT))`
    *   `+        self.styles.add(ParagraphStyle(name='NormalCenter', parent=self.styles['Normal'], alignment=TA_CENTER))`
    *   **Validation**:
        *   Setting `textColor=colors.whitesmoke` for `TableHeader` is a good refinement, especially if a dark background is used for headers (as done with `HexColor("#4F81BD")`).
        *   Adding `NormalRight` and `NormalCenter` provides useful pre-defined styles for aligning text within PDF tables.
    *   **Impact**: Improves PDF styling capabilities. Valid.

3.  **`export_report()` Method:**
    *   Added new dispatch conditions for `title == "Trial Balance"` for both "pdf" and "excel" `format_type`.
    *   Added placeholder dispatch conditions for `title == "General Ledger"`, currently falling back to `_export_generic_table_to_pdf` and `_export_generic_table_to_excel`.
    *   **Validation**: Correct. The dispatcher now specifically routes Trial Balance reports to new dedicated methods. The GL fallback is appropriate for this phase.
    *   **Impact**: Enables the new enhanced TB exports. No regression.

4.  **`_add_pdf_header_footer()` Method:**
    *   Minor coordinate adjustments for drawing strings to better position them relative to margins and page dimensions.
    *   `page_width = doc.width + doc.leftMargin + doc.rightMargin` calculated correctly.
    *   `header_y_start` calculation.
    *   `canvas.drawCentredString(page_width/2, ...)` uses `page_width/2` for centering.
    *   `canvas.drawRightString(page_width - doc.rightMargin, ...)` for right-aligning page number.
    *   **Validation**: These are good refinements for more accurate and robust header/footer placement in PDFs, especially considering potential variations in margins or page sizes. Valid.

5.  **`_export_balance_sheet_to_pdf()` and `_export_profit_loss_to_pdf()` Methods:**
    *   The logic for finding comparative account balances was slightly refined for robustness when an account in the current period might not have a comparative entry.
        ```diff
        - comp_bal_str = self._format_decimal(acc.get('comparative_balance')) if section.get('comparative_accounts') and \
        -                                next((ca for ca in section['comparative_accounts'] if ca['id'] == acc['id']), {}).get('balance') is not None else "" # More robust comparative access
        +                    comp_bal_str = ""
        +                    if section.get('comparative_accounts'):
        +                        comp_acc_list = section['comparative_accounts']
        +                        comp_acc_match = next((ca for ca in comp_acc_list if ca['id'] == acc['id']), None)
        +                        if comp_acc_match and comp_acc_match.get('balance') is not None:
        +                            comp_bal_str = self._format_decimal(comp_acc_match['balance'])
        ```
    *   **Validation**: This change is more readable and handles the case where `comparative_accounts` might be missing or the specific account might not have a comparative entry more explicitly. Functionally equivalent to the more compact original version but clearer. Valid.

6.  **NEW: `_export_trial_balance_to_pdf()` Method:**
    *   **Validation**: Correctly implemented.
        *   Uses `_add_pdf_header_footer`.
        *   Defines appropriate column widths and header texts for a Trial Balance.
        *   Iterates through `debit_accounts` and `credit_accounts` from `report_data`, populating the table with account code, name, and balance in the respective Debit or Credit column (leaving the other blank). Uses the new `NormalRight` style for amounts.
        *   Adds a formatted "TOTALS" row.
        *   Applies `TableStyle` for grid, header background, text alignment, and lines for totals.
        *   Includes a warning paragraph if `report_data['is_balanced']` is false.
    *   **Impact**: Provides a well-formatted PDF export for Trial Balance.

7.  **`_export_generic_table_to_pdf()` Method (GL Fallback):**
    *   Header for GL changed to include "JE Description" and "Line Description" separately.
    *   Column width calculations adjusted, especially for landscape GL and description fields.
    *   Text alignment for GL table cells refined (`NormalCenter` for date/entry no, `NormalRight` for amounts).
    *   **Validation**: These are good improvements for the generic GL PDF output, making it more readable even before a fully custom GL PDF export is created. Valid.

8.  **`_apply_excel_header_style()` and `_apply_excel_amount_style()` Methods (Excel Helpers):**
    *   `_apply_excel_header_style`: Added `fill_color` parameter. If provided, sets cell fill and makes font color white for contrast. `wrap_text=True` added to alignment for better header readability.
    *   `_apply_excel_amount_style`: Number format changed to `'#,##0.00;[Red](#,##0.00);"-"'` to show a dash for zero values, improving clarity. `underline` parameter added for borders.
    *   **Validation**: These are excellent enhancements to the Excel styling helpers, providing more flexibility and better visual output.

9.  **`_export_balance_sheet_to_excel()` and `_export_profit_loss_to_excel()` Methods:**
    *   Updated to use the enhanced `_apply_excel_header_style` (with `fill_color="4F81BD"`) for column headers.
    *   Updated to use the enhanced `_apply_excel_amount_style` (with `underline="thin"` or `"double"`) for total rows.
    *   Corrected logic for fetching comparative values for accounts to be more robust, similar to the PDF versions.
        ```python
        # Example for BS:
        # comp_val = None
        # if section.get('comparative_accounts'):
        #     comp_acc_match = next((ca for ca in section['comparative_accounts'] if ca['id'] == acc['id']), None)
        #     if comp_acc_match and comp_acc_match.get('balance') is not None: comp_val = float(comp_acc_match['balance'])
        # self._apply_excel_amount_style(ws.cell(row=row_num, column=3, value=comp_val if comp_val is not None else "-"))
        ```
    *   Column widths adjusted for better fit (e.g., 45 for description, 20 for amounts).
    *   **Validation**: These changes leverage the improved styling helpers and make the BS/P&L Excel exports more polished and consistent in appearance with the new TB export. The comparative value fetching is also more robust. Valid.

10. **NEW: `_export_trial_balance_to_excel()` Method:**
    *   **Validation**: Correctly implemented.
        *   Sets up worksheet and report headers (Company, Title, Date) using `_apply_excel_header_style`.
        *   Sets styled column headers.
        *   Populates data for debit and credit accounts, using `_apply_excel_amount_style` for amounts and leaving the opposing column blank or with a suitable placeholder (e.g., `None` which `_apply_excel_amount_style` might render as "-").
        *   Adds a styled "TOTALS" row with thin top borders for the amounts.
        *   Includes a warning if not balanced.
        *   Adjusts column widths.
    *   **Impact**: Provides a well-formatted Excel export for Trial Balance.

11. **`_export_generic_table_to_excel()` Method (GL Fallback):**
    *   Updated to use the enhanced `_apply_excel_header_style` with fill for column headers.
    *   Column for "JE Description" and "Line Description" split.
    *   Adjusted column widths for GL.
    *   Corrected the "Closing Balance" text alignment to be right-aligned before the amount.
    *   **Validation**: Improves the generic GL Excel export. Valid.

**Conclusion on `app/reporting/report_engine.py` Changes:**

The changes are **valid, well-implemented, and significantly enhance the export functionality for the Trial Balance report while also improving consistency and style for existing BS/P&L exports and the generic GL export.**
*   **Trial Balance**: Both PDF and Excel exports are now specifically formatted for better readability and professionalism.
*   **Styling Helpers**: Refinements to PDF paragraph styles and Excel cell styling helpers (`_apply_excel_header_style`, `_apply_excel_amount_style`) provide more control and better aesthetics.
*   **Consistency**: The BS and P&L Excel exports now benefit from these improved styling helpers.
*   **Robustness**: Small improvements in data handling, like fetching comparative values, add to robustness.
*   **No Loss of Functionality**: All previous export capabilities are maintained and improved. The generic methods serve as appropriate fallbacks.

The `ReportEngine` is now in a much better state for TB exports. The next step (Phase 2 of this task) would be to implement similarly enhanced, dedicated export methods for the General Ledger report.
