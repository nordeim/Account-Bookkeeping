Of course. I will now perform a rigorous line-by-line validation of the provided `diff` output for `app/reporting/financial_statement_generator.py`.

### **Diff Validation: `app/reporting/financial_statement_generator.py`**

**Objective:** Validate that the changes made to the `FinancialStatementGenerator` correctly implement the logic for the new Income Tax Computation report and that no existing report generation logic was accidentally omitted or altered.

1.  **Lines 4-11 (Imports):**
    *   **Change:** The commented-out `REMOVED` import lines were deleted. A new import for `ConfigurationService` was added under the `TYPE_CHECKING` block.
    *   **Reason:** The removed lines were placeholders from a previous refactoring and are no longer needed. The `ConfigurationService` is now required to fetch the default corporate tax rate.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** The changes accurately reflect the new dependencies of the class.

2.  **Lines 27-31 (`__init__` method):**
    *   **Change:** A new parameter `configuration_service` was added to the `__init__` method, and the corresponding instance variable `self.configuration_service` was set.
    *   **Reason:** This is the dependency injection for the newly required service.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** This change properly equips the generator with the tool it needs to fetch the tax rate.

3.  **Lines 108-142 (`generate_income_tax_computation` method):**
    *   **Change:** The entire method body was replaced. The old version was a simple stub, and the new version contains the complete implementation logic.
    *   **Analysis of New Logic:**
        *   It accepts a `FiscalYear` ORM object instead of an integer, which is a more robust approach.
        *   It correctly calls `generate_profit_loss` to get the base `net_profit_before_tax`.
        *   It correctly calls `account_service.get_accounts_by_tax_treatment` for both `'Non-Deductible'` and `'Non-Taxable Income'` accounts.
        *   It correctly loops through these accounts, calculates their period activity using `journal_service`, and aggregates the totals for `total_add_back` and `total_less`.
        *   It correctly calculates `chargeable_income`.
        *   It correctly fetches the `CorpTaxRate_Default` from the `configuration_service`.
        *   It correctly calculates the `estimated_tax` and handles the case where it might be negative.
        *   It returns a well-structured dictionary containing all the necessary components for rendering the report in the UI.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** The new implementation is logically sound, follows the plan precisely, and correctly implements the business logic for a simplified tax computation.

4.  **All Other Methods:**
    *   A line-by-line comparison of the other methods (`_get_account_type_map`, `_calculate_account_balances_for_report`, `generate_balance_sheet`, `generate_profit_loss`, `generate_trial_balance`, `generate_gst_f5`, `generate_general_ledger`) shows no functional changes. The `diff` only highlights the removal of the old `generate_income_tax_computation` stub and the addition of the new implementation.

### Final Conclusion

The `diff` has been meticulously reviewed. The changes are a correct and robust implementation of the new Income Tax Computation report generation feature. The logic is sound, uses the appropriate services, and produces a structured data output suitable for rendering.

I can confirm with high confidence that all changes are valid and that no original features or other report generation methods have been accidentally omitted or altered. The file is validated and ready.
