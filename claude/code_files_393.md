Of course. I will now perform a rigorous line-by-line validation of the provided `diff` output for `app/ui/reports/reports_widget.py`.

### **Diff Validation: `app/ui/reports/reports_widget.py`**

**Objective:** Validate that the changes made to the `ReportsWidget` correctly implement the UI and logic for the new "Income Tax Computation" report, and that no existing report functionalities have been accidentally omitted or altered.

1.  **Line 1-27 (Imports & Class Init):**
    *   **Change:**
        *   Minor reformatting of the file header comment.
        *   `FiscalYearData` and `FiscalYear` models were imported.
        *   A new instance variable `self._fiscal_years_cache: List[FiscalYearData] = []` was added.
        *   `_load_fs_combo_data()` is now called in the constructor, which in turn calls `_load_gl_accounts_for_combo` and the new `_load_fiscal_years_for_combo`.
    *   **Reason:** The new report type requires a list of available fiscal years for the user to select from. These changes add the necessary data structures and initialization calls to support the new "Fiscal Year" dropdown.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** These are necessary additions for the new feature.

2.  **Lines 29-37 & 70-76 & 100-112 (Formatting & Cleanup):**
    *   **Change:** Multiple methods (`_format_decimal_for_display`, `_handle_prepare_gst_f5_result`, `_handle_save_draft_gst_result`, etc.) were condensed from multi-line statements to single-line statements. The `current_user_id` variable was removed as it was only used once.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct and Harmless.** These are purely cosmetic changes that improve code density without affecting logic.

3.  **Lines 221-260 (`_create_financial_statements_tab`):**
    *   **Change:**
        *   "Income Tax Computation" was added to the `fs_report_type_combo`.
        *   A new `QComboBox` (`self.fs_fiscal_year_combo`) and its corresponding `QLabel` were created and added to the form layout.
        *   A new `QTreeView` (`self.tax_comp_tree_view`) was created and added to the `QStackedWidget` to display the report.
        *   The call to load GL accounts was moved to a new `_load_fs_combo_data` helper method.
    *   **Reason:** This implements the necessary UI components for the new report type as per the plan.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** All UI elements required for the new feature are correctly instantiated and placed.

4.  **Lines 262-267 (New `_load_fs_combo_data` method):**
    *   **Change:** A new method was created to orchestrate the loading of data for the various filter combo boxes.
    *   **Reason:** This is a good refactoring to group the asynchronous data loading calls that are needed when the widget initializes.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.**

5.  **Lines 269-281 (`_on_fs_report_type_changed`):**
    *   **Change:** The method was updated to handle the new "Income Tax Computation" report type. It correctly shows/hides the new Fiscal Year combo box and sets the current widget of the `QStackedWidget` to the new `tax_comp_tree_view`.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** The UI state changes correctly based on the selected report type.

6.  **Lines 304-325 (New `_load_fiscal_years_for_combo` and `_populate_fiscal_years_combo_slot` methods):**
    *   **Change:** New methods were added to asynchronously fetch all fiscal years from the `FiscalPeriodManager` and populate the `fs_fiscal_year_combo`.
    *   **Reason:** This is required to provide the user with a list of fiscal years to choose from when generating the tax computation report.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** The implementation follows the established async-fetch-then-populate-in-slot pattern used elsewhere in the application.

7.  **Line 327 (`_clear_current_financial_report_display`):**
    *   **Change:** The method was updated to handle clearing the new `tax_comp_tree_view`. The `update_data` call was corrected from `{}` to `[]` for table models.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** This ensures the UI is properly reset when a new report is generated.

8.  **Lines 352-357 (`_on_generate_financial_report_clicked`):**
    *   **Change:** A new `elif` block was added to handle the "Income Tax Computation" case. It correctly retrieves the selected fiscal year ID, finds the corresponding DTO from the cache, and calls the `generate_income_tax_computation` method in the `FinancialStatementGenerator`.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** This correctly wires the UI action to the backend logic for the new report.

9.  **Lines 482-491 (New `_populate_tax_computation_model` method):**
    *   **Change:** A new method was added to take the dictionary returned by the `FinancialStatementGenerator` and populate the `tax_comp_tree_view`.
    *   **Reason:** This is the presentation logic for the new report.
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** The method correctly iterates through the structured data (net profit, adjustments, totals) and creates a hierarchical view using `QStandardItem`, applying bold formatting for headers and totals.

10. **Line 499 (`_display_financial_report`):**
    *   **Change:** A new `elif` block was added to call `_populate_tax_computation_model` when the generated report's title is "Income Tax Computation".
    *   **Validation:** **Correct.** This correctly routes the generated data to the appropriate display method.

### Final Conclusion

The `diff` has been meticulously reviewed. All changes are correct and directly correspond to the plan for implementing the new Income Tax Computation report feature. The UI has been appropriately updated with new controls and a new display view, and the backend logic is correctly invoked. No existing report functionalities have been altered or omitted. The code is validated and ready.
