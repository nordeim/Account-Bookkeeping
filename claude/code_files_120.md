The `diff` output shows the changes made to `app/ui/reports/reports_widget.py` to replace the `QTextEdit` with a `QStackedWidget` hosting native Qt views (`QTreeView`, `QTableView`) for different financial reports.

Let's review the diff line by line to ensure correctness and completeness.

**Diff Review and Validation:**

*   **Lines 5-7 (Imports):**
    *   `QApplication` removed from `QtWidgets` import (wasn't used). Correct.
    *   `QStackedWidget, QTreeView, QTableView` added to `QtWidgets`. Correct.
    *   `QStandardItemModel, QStandardItem, QFont` added to `QtGui`. Correct.
*   **Line 14 (`from app.utils.pydantic_models import ...`)**:
    *   `AccountData` removed from import (was the cause of the previous error). Correct.
*   **Line 19-20 (New Model Imports):**
    *   `from .trial_balance_table_model import TrialBalanceTableModel` added. Correct.
    *   `from .general_ledger_table_model import GeneralLedgerTableModel` added. Correct.
*   **Line 33 (`self._gl_accounts_cache...`)**: No functional change, just context.
*   **Line 47 (`_format_decimal_for_display`)**:
    *   Parameter `show_blank_for_zero: bool = False` added. Correct.
    *   Logic `if show_blank_for_zero and d_value == Decimal(0): return ""` added. Correct.
    *   Ensures input `value` is converted to `Decimal` via `Decimal(str(value))` for robustness. Correct.
*   **Line 61 (`_create_gst_f5_tab`)**: Comment removed. No functional change. Correct.
*   **Line 115 (`_create_financial_statements_tab`)**:
    *   Comment "Financial Statements Tab" removed. No functional change. Correct.
    *   **Line 123-126 (GL Account Combo Completer)**: `QCompleter` setup for `fs_gl_account_combo` is added. Correct.
    *   **Line 138-167 (Report Display Area Refactoring)**: This is the core change.
        *   `self.fs_display_area = QTextEdit()` is **REMOVED**. Correct.
        *   `self.fs_display_stack = QStackedWidget()` is **ADDED**. Correct.
        *   `self.bs_tree_view`, `self.bs_model`, `self.pl_tree_view`, `self.pl_model`, `self.tb_table_view`, `self.tb_model`, `self.gl_table_view`, `self.gl_model` are all **CREATED** and configured. Correct.
        *   A `gl_widget_container` (QWidget with QVBoxLayout) is **CREATED** to hold the GL table and its summary labels (`gl_summary_label_account`, `gl_summary_label_period`, `gl_summary_label_ob`, `gl_summary_label_cb`). Correct.
        *   All these views are added as pages to `self.fs_display_stack`. Correct.
*   **Line 180 and subsequent GST methods**: These are unchanged as intended. Correct.
*   **Line 265 (`_on_fs_report_type_changed`)**:
    *   Logic to show/hide `fs_gl_account_combo` and `fs_gl_account_label` based on `is_gl_report` is correct.
    *   The loop for setting visibility of `QFormLayout` labels based on field widget is more robust. Correct.
    *   `self.fs_display_stack.setCurrentWidget()` is now used to switch between the different report views. Correct.
    *   Logic to clear the model of the *newly selected view* is added. This is important.
        *   `isinstance(current_view, QTreeView) and isinstance(current_view.model(), QStandardItemModel): cast(QStandardItemModel, current_view.model()).clear()` - Correct for tree views.
        *   `isinstance(current_view, QTableView) and hasattr(current_view.model(), 'update_data'): cast(Any, current_view.model()).update_data({})` - Correct for custom table models (passing empty data to their `update_data` method).
        *   The `cast` import was removed. This logic will cause a `NameError: name 'cast' is not defined`. **This needs to be fixed.** The models are known, so direct calls can be made or `cast` needs to be imported. *Self-correction: I will remove the `cast` calls and directly call `model.clear()` or `model.update_data({})` assuming the type checks are sufficient.*
*   **Line 290 (`_load_gl_accounts_for_combo`)**: No functional change from previous version, logic for loading accounts is fine.
*   **Line 303 (`_populate_gl_account_combo_slot`)**: No functional change.
*   **Line 315 (`_on_generate_financial_report_clicked`)**:
    *   The logic to clear the *current view's model* before generating a new report is added here as well. Similar `cast` issue.
*   **Line 355 (`_populate_hierarchical_model`)**: This is a completely new helper method to populate `QStandardItemModel` for `QTreeView` (BS and P&L).
    *   It clears the model, sets headers.
    *   Iterates through report sections and accounts to build the tree structure.
    *   Applies bold font to section titles and totals.
    *   Handles grand totals/summary lines for BS and P&L.
    *   This looks well-structured for its purpose.
*   **Line 407 (`_display_financial_report`)**: This method is heavily refactored.
    *   It now dispatches to different population logic based on `report_data.get('title')`.
    *   For "Balance Sheet" and "Profit & Loss Statement", it sets the current widget in the stack to the respective `QTreeView` and calls `_populate_hierarchical_model`. Then expands tree and resizes columns.
    *   For "Trial Balance", it sets current widget to `tb_table_view` and calls `self.tb_model.update_data(report_data)`.
    *   For "General Ledger", it sets current widget to `gl_widget_container`, calls `self.gl_model.update_data(report_data)`, and then updates the separate summary labels using `self.gl_model.get_report_summary()`.
    *   A fallback for unrecognized report titles is included.
    *   The old HTML generation logic is **REMOVED**. Correct.
    *   The `cast` call in the fallback also needs to be addressed.
*   **Line 457 (`_on_export_report_clicked`)**: No functional change, still uses `_current_financial_report_data`.
*   **Line 476 (`_handle_export_result`)**: No functional change.

**Identified Issues from Diff Review:**
1.  **`NameError: name 'cast' is not defined`**: The `cast` function from `typing` is used in `_on_fs_report_type_changed` and `_display_financial_report` (in the fallback case) without being imported.
    *   **Solution**: Either import `cast` from `typing` or remove the `cast` calls if type checks are sufficient for direct method access (e.g., `current_view.model().clear()`). Given that we know the model types, direct calls after `isinstance` checks are preferable.

**Completeness and Omission Check:**
*   The core logic of the `ReportsWidget` (GST F5 tab, overall structure, signal connections for existing buttons) appears to be preserved.
*   The new functionality for displaying financial statements in native views is added as planned.
*   The HTML display logic is correctly removed and replaced.

**Plan to Fix the `cast` Issue:**
1.  Remove the `cast(...)` calls in `_on_fs_report_type_changed` and `_display_financial_report`.
2.  Rely on `isinstance` checks before calling model-specific methods like `clear()` or `update_data({})`.

Let's apply this fix.
