The logs provided by the user are identical to the previous set (from response_46), showing a clean application startup and shutdown with no runtime errors. The Dashboard KPI feature appears to be functioning correctly, displaying initial data as expected for a new database setup.

The user's instruction "please continue" implies that they are satisfied with the current state and want me to proceed with the next planned task.

**Recap of Progress & Next Steps (from response_46):**

1.  **Previous Errors**: All previous runtime errors (ImportErrors, NameErrors) have been resolved.
2.  **Dashboard KPIs**: Implemented and displaying initial data correctly.
3.  **Automated Testing (Phase 1)**:
    *   Basic test infrastructure (`tests/conftest.py`, unit test directories) initiated.
    *   Unit tests for `TaxCalculator` created.
    *   Unit tests for Pydantic DTOs (`JournalEntryData`, `JournalEntryLineData`) created.
    *   Unit tests for `SequenceGenerator` created.
    *   Unit tests for `AccountTypeService` created.

**User's Request:**
The user wants me to continue with the plan, which is to further expand the automated test suite as part of "Automated Testing (Phase 1)".

**Proposing the Next Testing Target:**

We have tested:
*   A utility with core calculation logic (`TaxCalculator`).
*   DTO validation (`JournalEntryData` and `JournalEntryLineData`).
*   A utility with DB interaction and fallback logic (`SequenceGenerator`).
*   A simple service with CRUD-like operations (`AccountTypeService`).

A good next step would be to unit test another service class, perhaps one with slightly more complex query logic or more dependencies to mock, to solidify our testing patterns for services.

Candidates:
*   **`CurrencyService`**: Relatively simple, similar to `AccountTypeService`. Methods: `get_by_id` (code is ID), `get_all`, `add`, `update`, `delete`, `get_all_active`. Depends on `db_manager` and `app_core` (for user ID in `add`/`update`).
*   **`ExchangeRateService`**: Also fairly straightforward. Methods: `get_by_id`, `get_all`, `add`, `update`, `delete`, `get_rate_for_date`, `save`. Depends on `db_manager` and `app_core`.
*   **`FiscalPeriodService` or `FiscalYearService`**: These have more specific query logic (e.g., `get_by_date`, `get_by_date_overlap`).

Let's choose **`CurrencyService`** (`app/services/accounting_services.py`). It's a good next step in terms of complexity and importance.

**Execution Plan for Unit Tests for `CurrencyService`:**

1.  **Test File Creation**: `tests/unit/services/test_currency_service.py`.
2.  **Define Test Fixtures**:
    *   Mock `DatabaseManager` (`mock_db_manager` from previous test files can be reused or adapted if needed, providing a mock `AsyncSession`).
    *   Mock `ApplicationCore` (`mock_app_core`): `CurrencyService`'s `add` and `update` methods use `self.app_core.current_user.id`. So, the mock `app_core` will need a mock `current_user` attribute which in turn has an `id`.
    *   Sample `Currency` ORM objects.
3.  **Write Test Cases for `CurrencyService` methods**:
    *   `get_by_id(code: str)`: Test found (e.g., "SGD") and not found scenarios.
    *   `get_all()`: Test with empty list and list with multiple `Currency` objects, check ordering (by name).
    *   `add(entity: Currency)`:
        *   Verify `session.add`, `flush`, `refresh` are called.
        *   Verify `created_by_user_id` and `updated_by_user_id` are set if `app_core.current_user` is mocked and available.
    *   `update(entity: Currency)`:
        *   Similar to `add`, but focuses on `updated_by_user_id`.
    *   `delete(code: str)`: Test successful deletion and attempting to delete a non-existent currency code.
    *   `get_all_active()`: Test filtering for `is_active=True` and correct ordering.
4.  **Ensure tests are `async`** and use `pytest.mark.asyncio`.
5.  **Mocking Strategy**:
    *   Reuse the `mock_db_manager` and `mock_session` fixtures from `test_account_type_service.py` (they can be moved to `tests/unit/conftest.py` or a shared fixtures file if they become common, or redefined locally for now). For this response, I'll redefine them locally for clarity within the new test file.
    *   The mock `app_core` will need a `current_user` attribute that is an object with an `id` attribute.

This plan systematically builds upon our testing foundation.
</think>

The application is launching smoothly, and the Dashboard is displaying its initial (default) data correctly. This confirms all previous fixes for import errors and the `NameError` were successful. The detailed logging in `DashboardWidget` has also verified that the data flow for KPI display is working as intended.

We will now continue with the "Automated Testing (Phase 1)" roadmap goal. We have already established initial unit tests for:
*   `TaxCalculator`
*   Pydantic DTOs (`JournalEntryData`, `JournalEntryLineData`)
*   `SequenceGenerator`
*   `AccountTypeService`

**Next Step in Automated Testing: Unit Testing `CurrencyService`**

I will now create unit tests for the **`CurrencyService`**, located in `app/services/accounting_services.py`. This service handles CRUD operations for `Currency` entities and includes logic for fetching active currencies. Testing this service will further strengthen our test coverage of the data access layer and involve mocking database interactions and `ApplicationCore` for user auditing.

**Execution Plan for `CurrencyService` Unit Tests:**

1.  **Test File Creation**: A new file `tests/unit/services/test_currency_service.py` will be created within the existing `tests/unit/services/` directory.
2.  **Mock Dependencies**:
    *   `DatabaseManager`: Mock its `session()` context manager to return a mock `AsyncSession`.
    *   `AsyncSession`: Mock its methods (`get`, `execute`, `add`, `delete`, `flush`, `refresh`).
    *   `ApplicationCore`: Mock it to provide a `current_user` attribute, which itself will be a mock object with an `id` attribute, as `CurrencyService.add/update` methods use `self.app_core.current_user.id`.
3.  **Implement Test Cases**: Write `async` test cases for each public method of `CurrencyService`:
    *   `get_by_id(code: str)`: Test scenarios for finding a currency by its code and when it's not found.
    *   `get_all()`: Test responses with an empty list and a list of `Currency` objects, checking for correct ordering.
    *   `add(entity: Currency)`: Verify that the mock session's `add`, `flush`, and `refresh` methods are called. Crucially, verify that `created_by_user_id` and `updated_by_user_id` on the entity are set using the mocked `app_core.current_user.id`.
    *   `update(entity: Currency)`: Similar to `add`, focusing on `updated_by_user_id` being set.
    *   `delete(code: str)`: Test successful deletion and attempting to delete a non-existent currency.
    *   `get_all_active()`: Test that only active currencies are returned and that they are correctly ordered.
4.  **Assertions**: Focus on return values and interactions with mocked objects.

**Validation of Test Implementation for `CurrencyService`:**

*   **File Structure**: `tests/unit/services/test_currency_service.py` is correctly named and placed. The `__init__.py` for `tests/unit/services/` ensures it's a package.
*   **Fixtures**:
    *   `mock_session`, `mock_db_manager`: Reused pattern for mocking database interactions, looks correct.
    *   `mock_user`: Provides a mock user object with an `id` attribute.
    *   `mock_app_core`: Correctly provides a mock `ApplicationCore` with the `current_user` set to `mock_user`. This is essential for testing the audit user ID logic in `add` and `update` methods of the service.
    *   `currency_service`: Instantiates `CurrencyService` with the mocked `db_manager` and `app_core`.
*   **Test Cases**:
    *   `get_by_id()`: Covers "found" and "not found".
    *   `get_all()`: Checks for list return and basic content.
    *   `get_all_active()`: Checks filtering for `is_active=True`.
    *   `add()`: Verifies session calls and, importantly, checks if `created_by_user_id` and `updated_by_user_id` are set on the entity using the mocked user ID from `app_core`.
    *   `update()`: Similar to `add()`, verifies `updated_by_user_id`.
    *   `delete()`: Covers successful deletion and attempting to delete a non-existent currency code.
*   **Mocking and Assertions**: `AsyncMock` and `MagicMock` are used correctly. Assertions check return values and mock calls. The `side_effect` for `refresh` in `add`/`update` tests is a simple way to simulate ORM behavior without needing complex state in the mock.
*   **Async**: All tests are `async def` and the module is marked with `pytestmark = pytest.mark.asyncio`.

**Conclusion:**

The application continues to launch without errors, and the Dashboard KPIs are displaying initial data correctly.

We have further progressed with the "Automated Testing (Phase 1)" roadmap item by implementing a suite of unit tests for `CurrencyService`. These tests cover its main functionalities, including data retrieval, creation, update, deletion, and the correct application of user audit information via a mocked `ApplicationCore`.

This step reinforces the testing of our service layer. The patterns used for mocking the database session and `ApplicationCore` can be reused for testing other services.
