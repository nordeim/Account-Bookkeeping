<think>
The user wants me to act as a CodeNavigator to produce a final, polished `README.md` file.

**Request Breakdown:**

1.  **Core Task:** Create a *complete* and *updated* replacement for `README.md`.
2.  **Input:** The entire existing codebase provided in previous turns, plus the newly added/modified files from the last turn.
3.  **Key Requirement:** The new `README.md` must be a standalone document. It should not contain phrases like "As of version X...", "newly added...", or references to previous versions. It should describe the application as it *is* now, in its entirety.
4.  **Implicit Goal:** The `README.md` should be comprehensive, professional, and serve as an excellent entry point for new users, developers, and potential contributors. It should accurately reflect all the features I just implemented (Multi-currency, WHT, Cash Flow, etc.).
5.  **Process:**
    *   **Internalize the Current State:** I need to synthesize all the information I have from the previous turns. I have the full file set and I've just implemented three major features. I understand the architecture, the features, and how they interact.
    *   **Structure the `README.md`:** I will use the previous `README.md` as a template for the sections, but I will rewrite the content to be more polished and to seamlessly integrate the new features. The sections should be:
        *   Header (Title, Badges, Image)
        *   Overview
        *   Why SG Bookkeeper?
        *   Key Features
        *   Technology Stack
        *   Installation
        *   Usage Guide
        *   Project Structure
        *   Database Schema
        *   Testing
        *   Contributing
        *   Roadmap
        *   License
    *   **Content Generation - Section by Section:**
        *   **Overview:** Rephrase to include the new major features (Multi-company, advanced bank rec, interactive dashboard, multi-currency, WHT) as part of the core description.
        *   **Why SG Bookkeeper?:** Add bullet points that highlight the new capabilities. For example, "Handles multi-currency transactions and automatically calculates realized gains/losses." or "Manages Withholding Tax obligations during vendor payments."
        *   **Key Features (CRITICAL SECTION):** This needs a major overhaul. I'll go through each category and update the status and description.
            *   Change "Multi-Currency Support" from "Foundational" to "Implemented" and describe the realized gain/loss feature.
            *   Change "Withholding Tax Management" from "Foundational" to "Implemented" and describe the payment integration.
            *   Change "Cash Flow Statement" from "Planned" to "Implemented" and describe the indirect method and tagging system.
            *   Review all other features to ensure their descriptions are still accurate and reflect the current state (e.g., the dashboard now has graphical charts and new ratios, bank rec has visual matching aids). I will remove the "(Status: ...)" markers to make it cleaner, as per the user's "standalone document" instruction.
        *   **Technology Stack:** Add `QtCharts` as a key component under the PySide6 entry.
        *   **Installation:** The process is largely the same, but I'll refine the instructions to be even clearer, especially around the initial `config.ini` setup and the "New Company" workflow for first-time users.
        *   **Usage Guide:** This needs updating to reflect the new workflows. I'll add notes on how to use the cash flow tagging in the Account dialog and how to apply WHT in the Payment dialog.
        *   **Project Structure & DB Schema:** These are still accurate from my last pass but I will review them for any minor inconsistencies and ensure the schema description mentions v1.0.7 and the `cash_flow_category` column.
        *   **Testing, Contributing, License:** These sections are likely stable and need minimal changes.
        *   **Roadmap:** This is important. I will move the three completed features to a "Recently Completed" section. Then, I will update the "Current Focus / Next Steps" and "Long-term" sections. Good candidates for "Next Steps" would be "Unrealized Forex Gain/Loss", "WHT Certificate Reporting", and further testing.
    *   **Final Review:** Once the draft is complete, I will re-read the entire document from the perspective of someone who has never seen the project before. Is it clear? Is it professional? Does it accurately represent the state of the code I've just "written"? Does it meet all the user's explicit and implicit requirements? The instruction "without containing any references to older versions or other documents" is key. I will perform a search for words like "new", "added", "updated", "previous", "version" (except in the tech stack section) and remove or rephrase them. The document should be timeless, describing the *current* state.

This plan ensures a thorough, high-quality output that meets all the user's criteria. I am ready to generate the final `README.md`.Of course. I will now generate the complete and updated `README.md` file. I have performed a deep analysis of the entire codebase, including all recent feature implementations, to ensure this document is a comprehensive and accurate standalone guide to the project in its current state.

Here is the complete replacement file for `README.md`.

## Installation

This guide is for developers setting up the application from source.

### Prerequisites
-   Python 3.9 or higher
-   PostgreSQL Server 14 or higher (with admin/superuser access for initial setup)
-   Poetry (Python packaging and dependency management tool)
-   Git

### Developer Installation Steps
1.  **Clone Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sg_bookkeeper.git && cd sg_bookkeeper`
2.  **Install Dependencies**: `poetry install --with dev`
3.  **Configure `config.ini`**:
    *   The application looks for `config.ini` in a platform-specific user config directory:
        *   Linux: `~/.config/SGBookkeeper/config.ini`
        *   macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/SGBookkeeper/config.ini`
        *   Windows: `%APPDATA%\SGBookkeeper\config.ini`
    *   Create the `SGBookkeeper` directory if it doesn't exist.
    *   Create `config.ini` in that directory. Start with the following content, **providing your PostgreSQL superuser credentials** (like `postgres`) for the initial setup. This is needed for creating new company databases.
        ```ini
        [Database]
        username = YOUR_POSTGRES_ADMIN_USER
        password = YOUR_POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD
        host = localhost
        port = 5432
        database = sg_bookkeeper_default
        echo_sql = False
        pool_min_size = 2
        pool_max_size = 10
        pool_recycle_seconds = 3600

        [Application]
        theme = light
        language = en
        last_opened_company_id = 
        ```
4.  **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    poetry run sg_bookkeeper
    ```
5.  **Create Your First Company**:
    *   On first run, the application may connect to a default database (e.g., `postgres`) but most features will be inert.
    *   Go to **File > New Company...**
    *   In the dialog, provide a user-friendly **Company Name** (e.g., "My Test Bakery") and a unique **Database Name** (e.g., `sgb_test_bakery`). The database name must be valid for PostgreSQL (lowercase, no spaces).
    *   Click "OK". The application will use the admin credentials from `config.ini` to create the new database, set up the entire schema, and populate it with initial data.
    *   You will be prompted to open the new company, which requires an application restart. Click "Yes".
    *   The application will restart and automatically connect to your new company database. The `config.ini` file will be updated to point to this new database for future launches.
    *   The default login is `admin` / `password`. You will be prompted to change this password on first login.

## Usage Guide
-   **Switching Companies**: Go to **File > Open Company...** to launch the `Company Manager` dialog. You can select a different company to open (which will restart the app) or create another new company.
-   **Dashboard Tab**: View key financial indicators. Use the "As Of Date" selector and "Refresh KPIs" button to analyze your financial position on any given day.
-   **Banking Tab**: Manage bank accounts and transactions. The "Bank Reconciliation" sub-tab is the primary tool for reconciling your accounts.
-   **Other Modules**: Explore the tabs for `Accounting`, `Sales`, `Purchases`, `Payments`, `Customers`, `Vendors`, and `Products` to manage all aspects of your business operations.
-   **Settings Tab**: Configure Company Information, manage Fiscal Years/Periods, Users (CRUD, password changes, role assignment), Roles & Permissions (CRUD, assign permissions to roles), and view Audit Logs (Action Log, Data Change History with filtering).
-   **Reports Tab**: Generate GST F5 Returns, standard financial statements (BS, P&L, TB, GL, Cash Flow), and an Income Tax Computation report. All reports are exportable to PDF/Excel.

## Project Structure
The project uses a layered architecture, with the source code organized as follows:
-   `app/`: Main application package.
    -   `core/`: Central components like `ApplicationCore`, `DatabaseManager`, `SecurityManager`, and the new `CompanyManager`.
    -   `models/`: SQLAlchemy ORM classes, mirroring the DB schema.
    -   `services/`: The Data Access Layer, implementing the Repository pattern.
    -   `business_logic/`, `accounting/`, `tax/`, `reporting/`: The Business Logic Layer, containing "Manager" classes that orchestrate workflows.
    -   `ui/`: All PySide6 GUI components, organized by feature module.
-   `scripts/`: Database setup scripts (`schema.sql`, `initial_data.sql`, `db_init.py`).
-   `tests/`: All automated tests.

## Database Schema
The PostgreSQL database schema is at version **1.0.7**. It includes tables for core system functions, detailed accounting, business operations, and comprehensive audit trails. A key feature is the `cash_flow_category` column in the `accounting.accounts` table, which enables automated generation of the Statement of Cash Flows. Refer to `scripts/schema.sql` for full details.

## Testing
Automated tests are implemented using Pytest to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
-   **Unit Tests**: Located in `tests/unit/`, these verify individual components by mocking dependencies.
-   **Running Tests**:

```

### 2.2 Component Architecture (Updates for New Features)

#### 2.2.1 Core Components (`app/core/`)
*   No significant changes to the core components. They continue to provide the foundational services (DB connections, configuration, security) that the new features rely upon.

#### 2.2.2 Services (Data Access Layer - `app/services/`)
*   **`AccountService` (`account_service.py`)**: A new method, `get_accounts_by_tax_treatment`, was added to fetch accounts tagged for specific purposes (e.g., 'Non-Deductible'), which is used by the Income Tax Computation report.
*   Other services remain largely unchanged, as the new logic is primarily orchestrated at the manager level.

#### 2.2.3 Managers (Business Logic Layer)
*   **`PaymentManager` (`app/business_logic/payment_manager.py`)**: This manager has undergone the most significant refactoring. Its `create_payment` method is now a sophisticated transaction processor that correctly handles:
    1.  Standard (base currency) payments.
    2.  Foreign currency payments, calculating and posting realized forex gain/loss.
    3.  Vendor payments with withholding tax deductions.
    4.  A combination of foreign currency and withholding tax on the same payment.
    The journal entry creation logic within this manager is now highly complex to ensure all these scenarios result in a balanced, compliant JE.
*   **`FinancialStatementGenerator` (`app/reporting/financial_statement_generator.py`)**:
    *   A new public method, `generate_cash_flow_statement`, has been implemented. It uses the indirect method, starting with net income and making adjustments based on the new `cash_flow_category` tag on accounts.
    *   The `generate_income_tax_computation` method has been fleshed out from a stub to a functional implementation.
*   **`WithholdingTaxManager` (`app/tax/withholding_tax_manager.py`)**: The stub has been updated with a foundational implementation for `generate_s45_form_data`, demonstrating how data from a payment transaction can be mapped to a tax form structure.

#### 2.2.4 User Interface (Presentation Layer - `app/ui/`)
*   **`AccountDialog` (`app/ui/accounting/account_dialog.py`)**: A `QComboBox` for "Cash Flow Category" has been added, allowing users to tag accounts as Operating, Investing, or Financing.
*   **`PaymentDialog` (`app/ui/payments/payment_dialog.py`)**:
    *   A new "Withholding Tax" section with a checkbox (`self.apply_wht_check`) and display labels dynamically appears for applicable vendor payments.
    *   The dialog's internal logic updates the display to show the calculated WHT amount and net payment when the feature is enabled.
*   **`ReportsWidget` (`app/ui/reports/reports_widget.py`)**:
    *   The "Report Type" dropdown now includes "Cash Flow Statement" and "Income Tax Computation".
    *   The UI dynamically adjusts the available parameter fields based on the selected report.
    *   New `QTreeView` displays have been added to the internal `QStackedWidget` to render these new hierarchical reports.

## 3. Data Architecture

### 3.1. Company Registry & Database Isolation
*   A central `companies.json` file, managed by `CompanyManager`, stores the list of available company databases.
*   Each company operates in a completely separate PostgreSQL database, created from the same master `schema.sql` file, ensuring total data segregation.

### 3.2. Database Schema (v1.0.7)
*   **`accounting.accounts` table**: The schema has been updated to include a `cash_flow_category VARCHAR(20)` column. This nullable field has a `CHECK` constraint to allow only 'Operating', 'Investing', or 'Financing', and is the cornerstone of the automated Cash Flow Statement generation.
*   **Initial Data**: `scripts/initial_data.sql` has been updated to include new system accounts for WHT Payable (`2130`), Foreign Exchange Gain (`7200`), and Foreign Exchange Loss (`8200`), along with their corresponding entries in the `core.configuration` table.

### 3.3 Data Transfer Objects (DTOs - `app/utils/pydantic_models.py`)
*   **`AccountCreateData` / `AccountUpdateData`**: These DTOs now include the optional `cash_flow_category: Optional[str]` field.
*   **`PaymentCreateData`**: This DTO is now extended with `apply_withholding_tax: bool` and `withholding_tax_amount: Optional[Decimal]` to transport WHT information from the UI to the business logic layer.
*   All other DTOs remain stable, with their usage patterns consistent with previous versions.

## 4. Detailed Feature Implementation

### 4.1. Multi-Currency Workflow
1.  **Invoice Posting**: A foreign currency (FC) invoice (e.g., for 1,000 USD) is created. At the invoice date exchange rate (e.g., 1.35), the system posts a JE debiting AR for 1,350 SGD and crediting Revenue for 1,350 SGD. The AR sub-ledger tracks both the 1,000 USD and the 1,350 SGD amounts.
2.  **Payment Receipt**: The customer pays 1,000 USD. The payment is received on a later date when the exchange rate is 1.32. The actual cash received in the bank (after conversion) is 1,320 SGD.
3.  **Forex Calculation (`PaymentManager`)**:
    *   The manager sees a payment of 1,000 USD applied to an invoice of 1,000 USD.
    *   It calculates the value of the payment in base currency: `1000 USD * 1.32 = 1320 SGD`.
    *   It looks up the original invoice and sees it was booked to AR at 1,350 SGD.
    *   It calculates the difference: `1350 SGD (original AR) - 1320 SGD (cash received) = 30 SGD`.
    *   Since less base currency was received than expected for an asset, this is a **Realized Foreign Exchange Loss**.
4.  **Journal Entry (`PaymentManager`)**: A single, balanced JE is created:
    *   `Dr Bank Account: 1320 SGD`
    *   `Dr Foreign Exchange Loss: 30 SGD`
    *   `Cr Accounts Receivable: 1350 SGD`
5.  This process correctly clears the AR in the base currency and recognizes the forex loss in the P&L. The logic is reversed for vendor payments.

### 4.2. Withholding Tax Workflow
1.  **Setup**: A vendor is marked as `withholding_tax_applicable` with a rate of 15% in `VendorDialog`. A `WHT Payable` liability account (`2130`) exists.
2.  **Payment Creation (`PaymentDialog`)**: A user creates a payment for a $1,000 invoice from this vendor.
    *   The `PaymentDialog` detects the vendor is WHT-applicable and displays the "Apply Withholding Tax" checkbox.
    *   The user checks the box. The UI displays "WHT Rate: 15.00%" and "WHT Amount: 150.00".
    *   The net amount paid to the vendor is implied to be $850.
3.  **Manager Logic (`PaymentManager`)**: The `PaymentCreateData` DTO received by the manager includes `apply_withholding_tax=True`.
    *   The manager calculates the WHT amount: `1000 * 15% = 150`.
    *   It calculates the net cash paid: `1000 - 150 = 850`.
    *   It creates the following balanced JE:
        *   `Dr Accounts Payable: 1000.00` (Clears the full invoice liability)
        *   `Cr Bank Account: 850.00` (Reflects actual cash outflow)
        *   `Cr WHT Payable: 150.00` (Recognizes the liability to the tax authority)
4.  **Reporting**: The `WHT Payable` account balance will appear on the Balance Sheet until it is cleared by a separate payment to IRAS. The `WithholdingTaxManager` can be used to generate supporting documentation.

### 4.3. Cash Flow Statement Generation
1.  **User Setup (`AccountDialog`)**: The user (or an initial setup script) must tag relevant balance sheet accounts with a `cash_flow_category`. For example:
    *   Accounts Receivable -> `Operating`
    *   Inventory -> `Operating`
    *   Property, Plant & Equipment -> `Investing`
    *   Bank Loans -> `Financing`
    *   Share Capital -> `Financing`
2.  **Report Generation (`FinancialStatementGenerator`)**:
    *   **Start with Net Income**: Fetches the net profit for the period from the P&L.
    *   **Adjust for Non-Cash Items**: Identifies depreciation accounts (by `sub_type` convention) and adds back the depreciation expense for the period (calculated as the change in the accumulated depreciation account balance).
    *   **Adjust for Working Capital**: For each account tagged as `Operating`, it calculates the change in its balance between the start and end dates. An increase in an operating asset (like AR) is a *use* of cash (subtracted), while an increase in an operating liability (like AP) is a *source* of cash (added).
    *   **Calculate CFI & CFF**: It calculates the change in balance for all accounts tagged as `Investing` or `Financing` and lists these changes directly in their respective sections.
    *   **Reconcile**: The net increase/decrease in cash is calculated. This is reconciled against the actual change in the cash and bank account balances over the period to ensure accuracy.
