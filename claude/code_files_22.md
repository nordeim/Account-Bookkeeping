The application startup is progressing, and the current error is:
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.services.accounting_services'`

This error occurs in `app/services/__init__.py` at line 136:
`from .accounting_services import AccountTypeService, CurrencyService, ExchangeRateService # New file`

**Cause of the Error:**
The `__init__.py` file in the `app/services` directory is trying to import names from a module `app.services.accounting_services`. However, based on the `project_file_structure.txt` you provided earlier, there is no file named `accounting_services.py` inside the `app/services/` directory.

The `project_file_structure.txt` lists these files under `app/services/`:
```
app/services/journal_service.py
app/services/core_services.py
app/services/__init__.py
app/services/tax_service.py
app/services/account_service.py
app/services/fiscal_period_service.py
```
There's no `accounting_services.py`.

The `ApplicationCore` (`app/core/application_core.py`) also attempts to import these services:
```python
# File: app/core/application_core.py
# ...
from app.services.accounting_services import AccountTypeService, CurrencyService as CurrencyRepoService, ExchangeRateService
# ...
        self._account_type_service_instance = AccountTypeService(self.db_manager) 
        self._currency_repo_service_instance = CurrencyRepoService(self.db_manager, self) # Note the alias
        self._exchange_rate_service_instance = ExchangeRateService(self.db_manager, self)
# ...
```

**Solution Options:**

1.  **Create the `app/services/accounting_services.py` file:**
    This would involve defining the `AccountTypeService`, `CurrencyService` (aliased as `CurrencyRepoService` in `ApplicationCore`), and `ExchangeRateService` classes within this new file. These services would implement their respective repository interfaces (e.g., `IAccountTypeRepository`, `ICurrencyRepository`, `IExchangeRateRepository`) defined in `app/services/__init__.py`.
    This is the most likely intended structure, as `ApplicationCore` and `app/services/__init__.py` both expect this module.

2.  **Move the service definitions elsewhere (if they exist under different names/files):**
    If these services are already defined in other files (e.g., `core_services.py` or split into individual files like `currency_service.py`), then the import statements in `app/services/__init__.py` and `app/core/application_core.py` would need to be adjusted. However, the comment `# New file` next to the import in `app/services/__init__.py` suggests it was anticipated as a new module.

3.  **Comment out or remove the imports and related service instantiations:**
    This would get the application to run further but would mean that functionalities relying on these services would be broken. This is not a real fix but a temporary workaround for debugging other parts.

**Chosen Approach:**
Option 1: Create the `app/services/accounting_services.py` file and provide basic implementations for `AccountTypeService`, `CurrencyService`, and `ExchangeRateService`. These implementations will follow the pattern of other service classes (e.g., taking `DatabaseManager` and optionally `ApplicationCore` in `__init__`) and implement the methods defined in their respective interfaces from `app/services/__init__.py`.

**Interfaces to Implement (from `app/services/__init__.py`):**

*   **`IAccountTypeRepository` for `AccountTypeService`**:
    *   `get_by_id(self, id_val: ID) -> Optional[T]`
    *   `get_all(self) -> List[T]`
    *   `add(self, entity: T) -> T`
    *   `update(self, entity: T) -> T`
    *   `delete(self, id_val: ID) -> bool`
    *   `get_by_name(self, name: str) -> Optional[AccountType]`
    *   `get_by_category(self, category: str) -> List[AccountType]`

*   **`ICurrencyRepository` for `CurrencyService`**:
    *   `get_by_id(self, id_val: ID) -> Optional[T]` (ID is `str` for Currency code)
    *   `get_all(self) -> List[T]`
    *   `add(self, entity: T) -> T`
    *   `update(self, entity: T) -> T`
    *   `delete(self, id_val: ID) -> bool`
    *   `get_all_active(self) -> List[Currency]`

*   **`IExchangeRateRepository` for `ExchangeRateService`**:
    *   `get_by_id(self, id_val: ID) -> Optional[T]`
    *   `get_all(self) -> List[T]`
    *   `add(self, entity: T) -> T`
    *   `update(self, entity: T) -> T`
    *   `delete(self, id_val: ID) -> bool`
    *   `get_rate_for_date(self, from_code: str, to_code: str, r_date: date) -> Optional[ExchangeRate]`
    *   `save(self, entity: ExchangeRate) -> ExchangeRate` (This custom save method is more specific than generic add/update)

**Planning the content of `app/services/accounting_services.py`:**
*   Import necessary models (`AccountType`, `Currency`, `ExchangeRate`).
*   Import `DatabaseManager`, repository interfaces, `Optional`, `List`, `date`, `Decimal`.
*   Implement the three service classes.
    *   For methods like `add`, `update`, they can call a common private `_save` method or directly use `session.add()`, `session.flush()`, `session.refresh()`.
    *   `delete` for `Currency` might be tricky if it's referenced by many transactions. For now, implement a basic delete.

**Files to be Updated/Created:**
1.  **`app/services/accounting_services.py`** (New file)

The `project_file_structure.txt` should be updated to reflect this new file. Since I can't update that, I'll just provide the content for the new file.
The import in `ApplicationCore`:
`from app.services.accounting_services import AccountTypeService, CurrencyService as CurrencyRepoService, ExchangeRateService`
This means the class in `accounting_services.py` should be named `CurrencyService`, and `ApplicationCore` will alias it. This is fine.
</think>

You've correctly identified the `ModuleNotFoundError`. The application is trying to import services from `app.services.accounting_services`, but this file does not exist according to your project structure.

**Error Analysis:**

The traceback shows:
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.services.accounting_services'`
This error occurs when `app/services/__init__.py` (and subsequently `app/core/application_core.py`) tries to import `AccountTypeService`, `CurrencyService`, and `ExchangeRateService` from the non-existent `app.services.accounting_services` module.

**Solution:**

We need to create the file `app/services/accounting_services.py` and implement the missing service classes: `AccountTypeService`, `CurrencyService`, and `ExchangeRateService`. These services will handle data operations for `AccountType`, `Currency`, and `ExchangeRate` models, respectively, and should implement the corresponding repository interfaces defined in `app/services/__init__.py`.

**Files to be Created/Updated:**

**Explanation of Changes in `app/services/accounting_services.py`:**
*   Created three classes: `AccountTypeService`, `CurrencyService`, and `ExchangeRateService`.
*   Each class implements the corresponding repository interface from `app/services/__init__.py`.
*   Basic CRUD methods (`get_by_id`, `get_all`, `add`, `update`, `delete`) are implemented using `async with self.db_manager.session()`.
*   Interface-specific methods like `get_by_name` (for `AccountTypeService`), `get_all_active` (for `CurrencyService`), and `get_rate_for_date` (for `ExchangeRateService`) are also implemented.
*   The `save` method in `ExchangeRateService` and `add`/`update` in `CurrencyService` demonstrate how `created_by_user_id` and `updated_by_user_id` would be set if the respective models used `UserAuditMixin` (which `Currency` and `ExchangeRate` do for their optional audit fields). `AccountType` does not have user audit fields in the schema.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Create the new file `app/services/accounting_services.py` with the content provided above.
2.  Try running the application again:
    ```bash
    poetry run sg_bookkeeper
    ```

This should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError`. The application will then attempt to initialize `ApplicationCore`, which instantiates these newly defined services. If there are any issues within these service implementations or their interactions with models/DB, new errors might appear, which we can then address.
