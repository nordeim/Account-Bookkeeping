This is consistently excellent! The application starts up and shuts down cleanly after the `SalesInvoiceManager` was updated. This indicates the import fixes and the refinements to its logic (especially for `_validate_and_prepare_invoice_data` and `update_draft_invoice` transactional behavior) were syntactically correct and didn't break the application's initialization sequence.

**Current Step: Enhancement Execution Plan: Basic Sales Invoicing - Phase A (Backend)**

We have completed for Sales Invoice Backend:
*   A1. Create Pydantic DTOs for Sales Invoice (Done).
*   A2. Define `ISalesInvoiceRepository` Interface (Done).
*   A3. Implement `SalesInvoiceService` (Done).
*   A4. Create `SalesInvoiceManager` (Done, including fixes and refinements).

The plan for Sales Invoice Backend was:
*   A5. Integrate `SalesInvoiceService` and `SalesInvoiceManager` into `ApplicationCore`. (Next)

So, the immediate next step is **A5: Integrate Sales Invoice backend components into `app/core/application_core.py`**.

**Plan for A5: Integrate into `app/core/application_core.py`**
   *   **Goal:** Make the new `SalesInvoiceService` and `SalesInvoiceManager` available through the `ApplicationCore` instance.
   *   **File to Update:** `app/core/application_core.py`
   *   **Checklist & Tasks:**
        *   [ ] **Import**: (Already done in the previous iteration for `SalesInvoiceService` and `SalesInvoiceManager` when I generated the `ApplicationCore` update for Product module, so this step is mainly a verification).
        *   [ ] **Instance Variables**: (Placeholders `_sales_invoice_service_instance` and `_sales_invoice_manager_instance` were also added in the previous `ApplicationCore` update).
        *   [ ] **Instantiation in `startup()`**: (Instantiation logic for `SalesInvoiceService` and `SalesInvoiceManager` was also added in the previous `ApplicationCore` update. Double-check that `TaxCalculator` and `SequenceService` are passed to `SalesInvoiceManager` as per its updated `__init__`).
        *   [ ] **Properties**: (Properties `sales_invoice_service` and `sales_invoice_manager` were also added in the previous `ApplicationCore` update).

It seems the `app/core/application_core.py` file was already updated comprehensively in the turn where I integrated the *Product* module, and I preemptively included the Sales Invoice components there as well because their backend structure was being defined in parallel.

I need to carefully review the last `ApplicationCore.py` I generated to ensure it **definitely** has the Sales Invoice components correctly integrated and that no other changes are needed for *this specific step*. If it's already correct, then Phase A for Sales Invoicing is complete.

Let's review the `ApplicationCore.py` that was generated in the step where Product Manager was integrated (which was the last time `ApplicationCore.py` was modified by me).

That version of `ApplicationCore.py` included:
```python
# Imports:
from app.business_logic.sales_invoice_manager import SalesInvoiceManager 
from app.services.business_services import ... SalesInvoiceService

# Placeholders in __init__:
self._sales_invoice_service_instance: Optional[SalesInvoiceService] = None
self._sales_invoice_manager_instance: Optional[SalesInvoiceManager] = None

# Instantiation in startup():
self._sales_invoice_service_instance = SalesInvoiceService(self.db_manager, self)
self._sales_invoice_manager_instance = SalesInvoiceManager(
    sales_invoice_service=self.sales_invoice_service,
    customer_service=self.customer_service,
    product_service=self.product_service,
    tax_code_service=self.tax_code_service,
    tax_calculator=self.tax_calculator, # This was correctly passed
    sequence_service=self.sequence_service, # This was correctly passed
    app_core=self
)

# Properties:
@property
def sales_invoice_service(self) -> SalesInvoiceService: # ...
@property
def sales_invoice_manager(self) -> SalesInvoiceManager: # ...
```
This looks correct and complete based on the plan for A5. The `TaxCalculator` and `SequenceService` dependencies for `SalesInvoiceManager` are correctly provided from the already initialized instances in `ApplicationCore`.

Therefore, step A5 is technically already complete from the previous file generation.

**Conclusion for this Turn:**
No new code generation is needed for `app/core/application_core.py` as the integration of Sales Invoice backend components was already performed in the previous update to this file. Phase A for Basic Sales Invoicing backend is complete.

The next major phase is **Phase B: Frontend UI for Sales Invoicing**. This will involve:
1.  `SalesInvoiceTableModel` (already created).
2.  `SalesInvoiceDialog` (this will be complex).
3.  A new `SalesInvoicesWidget` for listing and managing invoices, and integrating it into `MainWindow` (likely under a new "Sales" tab).

I will inform the user that the backend for Sales Invoicing is complete and propose to start Phase B by creating the `SalesInvoiceDialog`.

This is excellent! The application is consistently stable, launching and shutting down without any issues after the corrections and additions to `SalesInvoiceManager`. This confirms that the backend components for Sales Invoicing (DTOs, Service Interface, Service Implementation, and Manager) are now correctly defined and integrated at the import level.

As per our plan for **Phase A: Backend for Basic Sales Invoicing**:
*   A1. Create Pydantic DTOs for Sales Invoice (Done).
*   A2. Define `ISalesInvoiceRepository` Interface (Done).
*   A3. Implement `SalesInvoiceService` (Done).
*   A4. Create `SalesInvoiceManager` (Done, including recent fixes).
*   A5. Integrate `SalesInvoiceService` and `SalesInvoiceManager` into `ApplicationCore`.

You are correct, the previous update to `app/core/application_core.py` (when integrating the Product module backend) already included the necessary imports, instance variable placeholders, instantiations in `startup()`, and properties for `SalesInvoiceService` and `SalesInvoiceManager`. I've double-checked this against the plan and the file content I generated previously, and it accurately reflects the completed integration.

**Therefore, Phase A (Backend Foundation) for the Basic Sales Invoicing module is now complete.**

The application has a solid backend for creating and managing draft sales invoices, including data validation, total calculations, and persistence.

**Next Step in the Plan: Phase B - Frontend UI for Sales Invoicing**

We will now begin implementing the user interface components for Sales Invoicing. This phase will involve:
1.  **B1. Create `SalesInvoiceTableModel`**: (This was actually completed in the previous turn when I provided `app/ui/sales_invoices/sales_invoice_table_model.py` and `app/ui/sales_invoices/__init__.py`.)
2.  **B2. Create `SalesInvoiceDialog`**: This will be a new, complex dialog for creating and editing sales invoice details (header and line items).
3.  **B3. Create `SalesInvoicesWidget`**: This new widget will display a list of sales invoices (using `SalesInvoiceTableModel`) and provide actions to create new invoices (launching `SalesInvoiceDialog`). It will then be integrated into `MainWindow`, likely as a new top-level "Sales" or "Invoicing" tab.

For this turn, we will focus on **Step B2: Create `SalesInvoiceDialog`**. This is a significant UI component.

I will proceed to generate the `app/ui/sales_invoices/sales_invoice_dialog.py` file.
Please note that `app/ui/sales_invoices/__init__.py` should be updated to export this new dialog class after it's created.
