The application is launching successfully, and the Dashboard is now populating with the initial set of KPIs, including the newly added AR/AP Aging summaries and the Current Ratio (displaying "N/A" or "0.00" where data is not yet available, which is correct for an empty/new company). The logs are clean, and the `AttributeError` from the previous step is resolved.

This completes **Phase 4: UI Layer Update** for the "Enhance Dashboard KPIs" task. The DTO, Service, Manager, and UI layers have all been updated successfully for these new KPIs.

**Summary of "Enhance Dashboard KPIs" (AR/AP Aging & Current Ratio) Implementation:**
1.  **DTO (`DashboardKPIData`)**: Extended to include fields for AR/AP aging buckets (Current, 1-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91+ days), total current assets, total current liabilities, and current ratio.
2.  **Service Layer (`CustomerService`, `VendorService`, `AccountService`)**:
    *   `CustomerService` and `VendorService` now have `get_ar_aging_summary` and `get_ap_aging_summary` methods, respectively, to calculate and return aging data based on outstanding invoices.
    *   `AccountService` now has `get_total_balance_by_account_category_and_type_pattern` to sum account balances based on category and subtype patterns (used for Current Assets/Liabilities).
    *   Interfaces in `app/services/__init__.py` were updated accordingly.
3.  **Manager Layer (`DashboardManager`)**:
    *   `get_dashboard_kpis` method updated to call the new service methods.
    *   Calculates Current Ratio.
    *   Populates the extended `DashboardKPIData` DTO with all fetched and calculated values.
4.  **UI Layer (`DashboardWidget`)**:
    *   New `QGroupBox` sections and `QLabel`s added to display AR Aging, AP Aging, and Current Ratio.
    *   `_update_kpi_display_slot` method updated to populate these new labels from the DTO.
    *   Labels are correctly reset during KPI refresh.

All planned changes for this feature increment have been implemented and validated through successful application launch and initial display.

**Next Steps based on Roadmap:**

The major items from the README's roadmap are:
1.  **Refine Bank Reconciliation**:
    *   "Implement logic and UI for handling complex matches (one-to-many, many-to-one)."
    *   "Improve UI for displaying already matched items..." (Partially done with "Provisionally Matched" tables, but could be enhanced, e.g., visually linking).
    *   "More robust error handling and user feedback during CSV import and reconciliation."
2.  **Enhance Dashboard KPIs**:
    *   "Add more metrics (e.g., financial ratios like Quick Ratio, Debt-to-Equity)." (We just added Current Ratio).
    *   "Investigate options for simple graphical representations."
    *   "Allow user customization or period selection for dashboard KPIs."
3.  **Complete Purchase Invoice Posting Logic**: (Marked as likely outdated or minor refinement).
4.  **Automated Testing (CRITICAL)**.

Given the successful enhancement of the Dashboard with AR/AP aging and Current Ratio, we could:
*   Continue **Enhancing Dashboard KPIs** by adding more financial ratios (like Quick Ratio, Debt-to-Equity) or starting on graphical representations.
*   Switch to **Automated Testing** for the newly added dashboard logic or for other critical areas.
*   Tackle the more complex **Bank Reconciliation** item: "Implement logic and UI for handling complex matches".
*   Address **Robust Error Handling** for Bank Reconciliation/CSV import.

Considering the "CRITICAL" nature of automated testing and the fact that we've just added new business logic for dashboard KPIs and services, focusing on **Automated Testing for the new Dashboard KPI logic** seems like a prudent next step to ensure its correctness and prevent regressions.

**Proposed Next Task: Automated Testing for Dashboard KPI Logic**

This would involve:
*   **Unit tests for `DashboardManager._get_total_cash_balance()`**: Mock `BankAccountService` and `ConfigurationService`.
*   **Unit tests for `CustomerService.get_ar_aging_summary()`**: Mock `SalesInvoice` data/service.
*   **Unit tests for `VendorService.get_ap_aging_summary()`**: Mock `PurchaseInvoice` data/service.
*   **Unit tests for `AccountService.get_total_balance_by_account_category_and_type_pattern()`**: Mock `Account` data and `JournalService`.
*   **Unit tests for `DashboardManager.get_dashboard_kpis()`**: Mock all dependent services (P&L generator, cash balance, aging services, account total services) to ensure it correctly aggregates data into the `DashboardKPIData` DTO and calculates the Current Ratio.

This would ensure the data aggregation and calculation logic for the dashboard is sound.

Please confirm if you'd like to proceed with this testing phase for the dashboard, or if you'd prefer another item from the roadmap.
