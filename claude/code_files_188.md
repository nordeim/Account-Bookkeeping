Okay, I have reviewed the `diff` output for `app/services/__init__.py`.

**Overall Assessment:**

The changes are **valid, correct, and accurately reflect the addition of the new `InventoryMovementService` and its corresponding interface `IInventoryMovementRepository`**. No original features or functions have been lost or omitted. The changes are purely additive and correctly integrate the new service into the existing structure of `app/services/__init__.py`.

**Detailed Review of Changes (Diff Analysis):**

1.  **Line 38: `+from app.models.business.inventory_movement import InventoryMovement # New Import`**
    *   **Validation**: Correct. The `InventoryMovement` ORM model is needed for the new `IInventoryMovementRepository` interface definition.
    *   **Impact**: Adds a necessary import. No regression.

2.  **Lines 200-202: Whitespace changes in `IPurchaseInvoiceRepository`**
    *   `IPurchaseInvoiceRepository(IRepository[PurchaseInvoice, int]):`
        ```diff
        -    
        -    @abstractmethod
        -    async def get_by_vendor_and_vendor_invoice_no(self, vendor_id: int, vendor_invoice_no: str) -> Optional[PurchaseInvoice]: pass
        -    
        +    @abstractmethod
        +    async def get_by_vendor_and_vendor_invoice_no(self, vendor_id: int, vendor_invoice_no: str) -> Optional[PurchaseInvoice]: pass
        ```
    *   **Validation**: This is just a whitespace adjustment (removal of blank lines). The method `get_by_vendor_and_vendor_invoice_no` and its signature are preserved. This change is stylistic and has no functional impact. It's valid.

3.  **Lines 209-213: Addition of `IInventoryMovementRepository`**
    *   **Validation**: Correct. A new interface `IInventoryMovementRepository` is defined, inheriting from the generic `IRepository`.
    *   It correctly specifies `InventoryMovement` as the type `T` and `int` as the type `ID`.
    *   It defines an abstract method `save(self, entity: InventoryMovement) -> InventoryMovement`. While `IRepository` already has `add` and `update`, explicitly defining `save` here is acceptable if the intent is to have a single method for both creation and update for this specific service, or if it will have a slightly different semantic (e.g., requiring an external session more strictly). Given the context, a dedicated `save` is fine.
    *   The comment `# Add other specific methods if needed...` is appropriate.
    *   **Impact**: Adds the new interface definition. No regression.

4.  **Line 221: Update to `business_services` import**
    *   `+ SalesInvoiceService, PurchaseInvoiceService, InventoryMovementService # Added InventoryMovementService`
    *   **Validation**: Correct. The newly implemented `InventoryMovementService` from `app/services/business_services.py` is now imported.
    *   **Impact**: Makes the new service class available for export. No regression.

5.  **Lines 230 & 236: Update to `__all__` export list**
    *   `+    "IInventoryMovementRepository", # New export`
    *   `+    "InventoryMovementService", # New export`
    *   **Validation**: Correct. The new interface and service class are added to the `__all__` list, making them available for import when `from app.services import *` is used (though direct imports are generally preferred).
    *   **Impact**: Correctly exports the new components. No regression.

**Conclusion on `app/services/__init__.py` Changes:**

The changes are entirely additive and correctly incorporate the new `IInventoryMovementRepository` interface and the `InventoryMovementService` implementation into the services module's central `__init__.py` file. All existing exports and definitions are preserved. The file remains well-structured and the changes are consistent with the project's patterns.

The modifications are valid and ready.
