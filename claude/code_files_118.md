The application is still launching and shutting down cleanly. This is excellent! It means the creation of the new table models (`TrialBalanceTableModel`, `GeneralLedgerTableModel`) and the update to `app/ui/reports/__init__.py` were successful and did not introduce any startup issues.

**Current Step: Enhancement Execution Plan: Refine Reporting UI with Native Qt Views**

We have completed:
*   **Phase 1: Backend - Data Structure Review (No changes needed)**
*   **Phase 2: Frontend - Reporting UI Refinement in `app/ui/reports/reports_widget.py`**
    *   **A. Create New Table/Tree Models:**
        *   `app/ui/reports/trial_balance_table_model.py` (Done)
        *   `app/ui/reports/general_ledger_table_model.py` (Done)
    *   **C. Update `__init__.py` files:**
        *   `app/ui/reports/__init__.py` (Done - exports new models)

The next and most significant part of this plan is:
    *   **B. Update `app/ui/reports/reports_widget.py`:**
        *   Replace `QTextEdit` with a `QStackedWidget`.
        *   Add `QTreeView` instances (for BS, P&L) and `QTableView` instances (for TB, GL).
        *   Initialize `QStandardItemModel`s for tree views and the new custom table models for table views.
        *   Update `_on_fs_report_type_changed()` to switch the `QStackedWidget` and clear appropriate models.
        *   Update `_display_financial_report()` to populate the correct view/model based on report type.
            *   For BS/P&L, populate the `QStandardItemModel` for `QTreeView`.
            *   For TB/GL, call `update_data()` on the respective custom table models.

**Plan for this Turn: Update `app/ui/reports/reports_widget.py` for Native Views**

**Objective:** Refactor the "Financial Statements" tab in `ReportsWidget` to use a `QStackedWidget` containing `QTreeView` (for Balance Sheet, P&L) and `QTableView` (for Trial Balance, General Ledger) with their respective models, replacing the single `QTextEdit` display.

**Detailed Plan & Checklist for `app/ui/reports/reports_widget.py`:**

*   [ ] **Imports**: Add `QStackedWidget`, `QTreeView`, `QStandardItemModel` (from `QtGui`), `TrialBalanceTableModel`, `General
