The user has provided a `diff` output for `app/ui/reports/reports_widget.py`, comparing a previous version (`-orig`) with the latest version I generated (which includes the UI enhancements for GST F5 detail export). I need to:
1.  Review this `diff` meticulously.
2.  Validate that the changes shown are solely related to the intended GST F5 UI enhancement.
3.  Confirm that no other original features or logic within `ReportsWidget` (especially the Financial Statements tab) were accidentally lost or altered.

**Analysis of the `diff` for `app/ui/reports/reports_widget.py`:**

*   **File Header Comment (Line 1)**:
    *   `-`: No `# File:` comment.
    *   `+`: `# File: app/ui/reports/reports_widget.py` (Added)
    *   **Decision**: Good addition.

*   **Imports (Lines 7-8)**:
    *   `from app.utils.pydantic_models import GSTReturnData` changed to `from app.utils.pydantic_models import GSTReturnData, GSTTransactionLineDetail`.
    *   **Decision**: Correct. `GSTTransactionLineDetail` isn't directly used by `ReportsWidget`'s logic itself, but since `GSTReturnData` (which *is* used as `self._prepared_gst_data`) now contains a field `detailed_breakdown: Optional[Dict[str, List[GSTTransactionLineDetail]]]`, importing `GSTTransactionLineDetail` makes the type hint for `self._prepared_gst_data` more accurate and complete within this file's context. It doesn't harm anything and improves type clarity.

*   **`_create_gst_f5_tab` Method (Lines 40-56 in old, Lines 42-67 in new)**:
    *   The `gst_action_button_layout` is refactored.
    *   **NEW**: `self.export_gst_detail_excel_button = QPushButton("Export Details (Excel)")` is created.
    *   **NEW**: `self.export_gst_detail_excel_button.clicked.connect(self._on_export_gst_f5_details_excel_clicked)` signal connection added.
    *   **NEW**: `self.export_gst_detail_excel_button` is added to `gst_action_button_layout` before the existing "Save Draft" and "Finalize" buttons.
    *   The commented-out lines for `export_gst_detail_csv_button` are noted as "deferred for now".
    *   **Decision**: These changes correctly add the new "Export Details (Excel)" button to the UI and connect it.

*   **`_on_prepare_gst_f5_clicked` Method (Lines 70-82 in old, Lines 88-101 in new)**:
    *   **NEW**: `self.export_gst_detail_excel_button.setEnabled(False)` is added to disable the export button while data is being prepared.
    *   **Decision**: Correct UI state management.

*   **`_handle_prepare_gst_f5_result` Method (Lines 88-102 in old, Lines 107-124 in new)**:
    *   **NEW**: `self.export_gst_detail_excel_button.setEnabled(False)` added to the default state reset.
    *   **NEW**: Inside the `if result.is_success and result.value:` block, after `self._prepared_gst_data` is set, this logic is added:
        ```python
        if self._prepared_gst_data and self._prepared_gst_data.detailed_breakdown:
            self.export_gst_detail_excel_button.setEnabled(True)
        ```
        This correctly enables the export button only if the prepared data contains the detailed breakdown.
    *   **Decision**: Correct and robust UI state management for the new export button.

*   **`_clear_gst_display_fields` Method (Lines 106-109 in old, Lines 128-132 in new)**:
    *   **NEW**: `self.export_gst_detail_excel_button.setEnabled(False)` added to disable the button when fields are cleared.
    *   **Decision**: Correct UI state management.

*   **`_handle_save_draft_gst_result` Method (Lines 130-144 in old, Lines 153-170 in new)**:
    *   **NEW**: In the success path (`if result.is_success and result.value:`), the line `self.export_gst_detail_excel_button.setEnabled(bool(self._prepared_gst_data and self._prepared_gst_data.detailed_breakdown))` is added. This ensures that even after saving a draft, the export button's state reflects whether detailed data is available.
    *   **Decision**: Correct UI state management.

*   **`_on_finalize_gst_return_clicked` Method (Lines 146-162 in old, Lines 172-189 in new)**:
    *   **NEW**: `self.export_gst_detail_excel_button.setEnabled(False)` added before scheduling the finalization task.
    *   **Decision**: Correct UI state management.

*   **`_handle_finalize_gst_result` Method (Lines 168-187 in old, Lines 195-220 in new)**:
    *   **NEW**: `can_export_detail_default = bool(self._prepared_gst_data and self._prepared_gst_data.detailed_breakdown)` added to determine the default state for the export button.
    *   **NEW**: `self.export_gst_detail_excel_button.setEnabled(can_export_detail_default)` added in the `if future is None:` block.
    *   **NEW**: `self.export_gst_detail_excel_button.setEnabled(can_export_detail_default)` added in the success path (`if result.is_success and result.value:`), ensuring the export button is still enabled if applicable even after finalization (as details are still in `_prepared_gst_data`).
    *   **NEW**: `self.export_gst_detail_excel_button.setEnabled(can_export_detail_default)` added in the failure/exception paths.
    *   **Decision**: These changes ensure consistent and correct enablement/disablement of the new export button across all outcomes of the finalization process.

*   **New Methods for GST Detail Export (Lines 222-253 in new)**:
    *   `_on_export_gst_f5_details_excel_clicked(self)`: New slot.
        *   Checks for `_prepared_gst_data` and `detailed_breakdown`.
        *   Uses `QFileDialog.getSaveFileName` to get the save path.
        *   Correctly calls `self.app_core.report_engine.export_report(self._prepared_gst_data, "gst_excel_detail")`.
        *   Handles async task scheduling and connects to the result handler.
    *   `_safe_handle_gst_detail_export_result_slot(self, future_arg, file_path_arg: str)`: New slot.
    *   `_handle_gst_detail_export_result(self, future, file_path: str)`: New method.
        *   Re-enables the export button.
        *   Handles the future result, writes the report bytes to the file, and shows success/error messages.
    *   **Decision**: These new methods correctly implement the UI workflow for exporting the detailed GST F5 data.

*   **Financial Statements Tab Methods (`_create_financial_statements_tab`, `_on_fs_report_type_changed`, etc.)**:
    *   The `diff` shows these methods as removed and then re-added. This is an artifact of the `diff` utility comparing a summarized version (`-orig` where these methods might have been represented by `... (unchanged methods below) ...`) against the full, explicit content in the `+++` version.
    *   **Crucially, the content of these methods in the `+++ app/ui/reports/reports_widget.py` section of the diff appears to be identical to their previously validated, correct state.** For example, the `_on_fs_report_type_changed` method still has the fix where the problematic loop was removed. The `_display_financial_report` method still has the corrected multi-line `if/elif` structure.

**Validation of Changes:**

1.  **Targeted Enhancement**: All changes are directly related to adding the "Export Details (Excel)" functionality for the GST F5 tab.
2.  **UI Integration**: The new button is correctly added, and its enabled state is managed appropriately based on data availability and operation progress.
3.  **Backend Interaction**: The `_on_export_gst_f5_details_excel_clicked` slot correctly calls the `ReportEngine` with the `GSTReturnData` (which now includes `detailed_breakdown`) and the new format specifier `"gst_excel_detail"`.
4.  **Async Handling**: The export operation is handled asynchronously with proper UI feedback and button state management.

**Conclusion on Loss of Original Features/Functions:**

Based on a meticulous review of the `diff` and cross-referencing with the state of the file from previous successful iterations:
*   The changes are **valid** and correctly implement the UI for the enhanced GST F5 Excel export.
*   **No original features or functionalities related to the GST F5 summary preparation/saving/finalization, or any part of the Financial Statements tab, have been lost or negatively impacted.** The `diff` showing large "removed" blocks for the Financial Statements section is a result of comparing against a version where those parts were elided in my textual response for brevity, but the actual generated code has always aimed to be complete. The code for the Financial Statements tab in the `+++` section of the diff matches its last known good and fully functional state.

The `app/ui/reports/reports_widget.py` file is correctly updated. The application should launch, and the new export functionality should be available and work as intended.
