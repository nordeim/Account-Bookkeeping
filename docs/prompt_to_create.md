You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

I am running a small business in Singapore, and I need a decent and capable bookkeeping application to manage my accounts and to collect relevant financial data for the annual income tax reporting. You are also familiar with Singapore's accounting standards. Help me create a comprehensive `Product Requirements Document` (PRD) enclosed within ```markdown opening and ``` closing tags, that I can use to design and build a very awesomely useful, easy-to-use (intuitive), capable yet modern Python PyQt/PySide GUI-based account bookkeeping application that uses a local PostgreSQL database as a persistent datastore.

You have done an awesome job! But I know you can refine your PRD to be more detailed, comprehensive and with enough technical details to help guide software developers to code closer to your intended specifications. Make sure your PRD defines an application that can meet the following criteria. Please think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly for the best implementation for such a software application, then choose the best implementation option to create a refined and more awesome `Product Requirements Document: Singapore Small Business Bookkeeping Application` in markdown format. Please give me your best shot and good luck. Now proceed and give me a pleasant surprise!

# Target Users
- Small business owners/managers with limited accounting expertise
- Administrative staff responsible for day-to-day transactions
- Accountants working with small businesses
- External consultants who may need financial reports

# User Needs
- Simplified transaction entry without accounting expertise
- Clear financial position visibility
- Compliant tax preparation and reporting
- Secure data storage and backup
- Intuitive navigation and workflows

Empowers Singapore-based micro and small enterprises to:
1. Maintain double-entry books effortlessly.
2. Stay compliant with the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS) and IRAS tax-filing requirements (Form C-S/C).
3. Generate insightful financial reports (P&L, Balance Sheet, GST returns, etc.) in minutes, not hours.

Aiming for:
• Zero-friction data entry.  
• Beautiful, modern UI that feels native on Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
• Robust local PostgreSQL storage with encrypted backups.  
• One-click export of IRAS-ready tax schedules and XBRL-ready data.

That is an awesome refinement! Now, please create a detailed and awesome `Technical Design Specification Document` in markdown format to describe the application based on your `Product Requirements Document`. Your TDS should describe the detailed specifications, including feature set, logic flow, user interaction, database schema, user input and output screens, code structure, code logic explanation with snippets, deployment guide and so on. Your awesome TDS aims to help even a novice software developer to build the application easily and with the correct functionalities. Use at least 6000 words to create your detailed `Technical Design Specification Document` in markdown format. Again, give me your very best shot and good luck!

---
Again, that is another excellent piece of work! Now, please create a complete PostgreSQL script to create the complete database schema that accurately meets your PRD and TDS documents. create the SQL script as `create_complete_database_schema.sql` within ```sql and ``` tags. Please add as many detailed comments as possible to each database objects to help software developers correctly use the database objects in building the code for the application. again, please give me your very best shot!


---
That is an absolutely awesome job! Please create an equally awesome `README.md` for the new GitHub repository to host your awesome account bookkeeping application. Make the GitHub repo README in markdown format so attractive, informative and detailed to attract developers to the project. Use at least 3000 words to create an insanely good and useful and informative `README.md`. Again, give me your very best shot and again good luck!
