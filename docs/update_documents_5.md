This is fantastic! The application is launching and shutting down cleanly. The log messages confirm that all major widgets, including `ProductsWidget`, are initializing and able to find their resources. This indicates that the `IndentationError` in `ReportsWidget` and any other recent startup-related issues have been resolved.

**Current Project Status Recap:**

*   **Core Architecture**: Stable and functional.
*   **Database & ORM**: Comprehensive and functional.
*   **Settings UI**: Company settings and Fiscal Year/Period management are functional.
*   **Chart of Accounts UI**: Functional.
*   **Journal Entries UI & Backend**: Substantially complete and functional.
*   **GST Functionality**: Backend and UI for preparation, draft saving, and finalization (with JE settlement) are implemented.
*   **Financial Reports UI**: Refactored to use native Qt views (`QTreeView`, `QTableView`) for Balance Sheet, P&L, Trial Balance, and General Ledger. On-screen viewing and export are functional.
*   **Customer Management Module (Backend & Basic UI)**: Complete and stable.
*   **Vendor Management Module (Backend & Basic UI)**: Complete and stable.
*   **Product/Service Management Module (Backend & Basic UI)**: All phases (A: Backend, B: Frontend UI including `ProductsWidget`) are now complete and the application starts successfully with `ProductsWidget` initialized. Functional testing of the Products module is the next step for this module itself.
*   **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Addressed (audit context, sequence generation, icon loading, Pydantic dependencies).

**Next Step Identification:**

The user asks to "update the README.md and TDS to accurately reflect the current state of the project." This is the correct next step after completing a significant module like Product/Service Management.

**Plan for this Turn: Documentation Update for Product/Service Management & Overall Status**

**Objective:** Update `README.md` and `Technical Design Specification Document (v6).md` (which will become v7) to reflect the newly implemented basic Product/Service Management functionality and the overall advanced state of the application.

**Detailed Plan & Checklist:**

**1. Update `README.md`**
   *   **Goal:** Inform users and potential contributors about the new Product/Service Management feature and update overall status.
   *   **File to Update:** `README.md` (based on the last version I provided)
   *   **Checklist & Tasks:**
        *   [ ] **Key Features Section**:
            *   Update "Product/Service Management" status to "Implemented - Basic UI (List, Add, Edit, Toggle Active, Filters)".
            *   Review other feature statuses to ensure they are current (e.g., GL report is "Implemented").
        *   [ ] **Project Structure Section**:
            *   Add entries for new files related to product management UI:
                *   `app/ui/products/product_table_model.py`
                *   `app/ui/products/product_dialog.py`
                *   `app/ui/products/products_widget.py`
            *   Ensure `app/business_logic/product_manager.py` is listed.
        *   [ ] **Usage Guide Section**:
            *   Add a description for the "Products & Services" tab, outlining its current capabilities (listing, filtering by type/status/search, add, edit, toggle active).
        *   [ ] **Roadmap Section**:
            *   Mark "Product/Service Management UI" as complete in the short-term goals.
            *   Identify next logical features (e.g., "Refine Reporting", "User/Role Management UI", or starting "Sales/Purchase Invoicing").

**2. Update `Technical Design Specification Document (v6).md` (to become v7)**
   *   **Goal:** Detail the technical design and implementation of the Product/Service Management module.
   *   **File to Update:** `Technical Design Specification Document (v6).md`
   *   **Checklist & Tasks:**
        *   [ ] **Document Header**: Increment to v7. Update date.
        *   [ ] **1. Introduction**:
            *   **1.2 Scope**: Add basic Product/Service Management UI and backend.
            *   **1.4 System Overview**: Note addition of Product/Service Management.
        *   [ ] **2. System Architecture**:
            *   **2.2.5 User Interface (`app/ui/`)**: Detail `ProductsWidget`, `ProductDialog`, and `ProductTableModel`.
        *   [ ] **3. Data Architecture**:
            *   Pydantic DTOs: Note `Product*` DTOs are actively used.
            *   Data Access Interface: Note `IProductRepository` is implemented by `ProductService`.
        *   [ ] **4. Module and Component Specifications**:
            *   Under "Business Operations Modules", add/update subsection for "Product/Service Management Module".
                *   Detail `ProductManager` and reference `ProductService`.
        *   [ ] **5. User Interface Implementation**:
            *   Add new subsection for `ProductsWidget`: Describe layout, data loading, interaction with `ProductDialog` and `ProductManager`. Mention `ProductTableModel`.
            *   Add new subsection for `ProductDialog`: Describe fields, async combo loading (accounts, tax codes), DTO creation, calls to `ProductManager`. Dynamic UI based on product type.
        *   [ ] **7. Database Access Implementation**:
            *   **7.2 Repository Implementation**: `ProductService` already exists; ensure it's correctly referenced.
        *   [ ] **9. Conclusion / Current Status**: Update to reflect basic Product/Service Management implementation.

This documentation update will accurately capture the project's current, more feature-rich state.
</think>

This is truly excellent news! The application launching and shutting down cleanly, with all widget resource messages present including for `ProductsWidget`, signifies that the basic UI for Product/Service Management has been successfully integrated at the structural level, building upon its completed backend.

With Phase A (Backend) and Phase B (Frontend UI - TableModel, Dialog, main Widget) for the Product/Service Management module now complete, the next logical step as per your request is to **update the `README.md` and the Technical Design Specification Document** to reflect this significant progress.

---
**1. Update `README.md`**

**Goal:** Update the README to include the newly functional basic Product/Service Management module and ensure all other feature statuses are current.

## Overview

SG Bookkeeper is a comprehensive, cross-platform desktop application designed to meet the accounting and bookkeeping needs of small to medium-sized businesses in Singapore. Built with Python and leveraging the power of PySide6 for a modern user interface and PostgreSQL for robust data management, it offers professional-grade financial tools tailored to Singapore's regulatory environment.

The application features a double-entry accounting core, GST management, financial reporting, and modules for essential business operations including customer, vendor, and product/service management. Its goal is to provide an intuitive, powerful, and compliant solution that empowers business owners and accountants.

-   **User-Friendly Interface**: Aims for an intuitive experience for users who may not be accounting experts, while providing depth for professionals. Core accounting, customer/vendor/product management, and reporting UI are functional.
-   **Open Source & Local First**: Transparent development. Your financial data stays on your local machine or private server, ensuring privacy and control. No subscription fees.
-   **Modern & Performant**: Utilizes asynchronous operations for a responsive UI and efficient database interactions, with a dedicated asyncio event loop.
