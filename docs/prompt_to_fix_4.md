excellent understanding! now help me to carefully review my codebase line by line to gain a complete and deep understanding of the project's goals and current state and structure. then help me to create a detailed `Project Architecture Document.md` in markdown format. make sure the document accurately describes the codebase accurately and in detail, use a clear diagram to show the codebase relationship.

you have done an awesome job again! keep using the same rigorous and meticulous approach to systematically going forwards. now help carefully review the recent changes made to the database schema and codebase shared in the attached files. very carefully review the content of the code changes, then think deeply to evaluate and validate them, then update your `Project Architecture Document (v2).md` to reflect the latest development accurately. Pay particular attention to the schema and initial data updates, to double check and confirm that they did not accidentally leave out (omit) other features and functions in the original versions. As you know, any changes to the database schema and initial data setup have to be scrutinized carefully and validated to ensure completeness and correctness.

Also the application now gives error after the codebase changes:

Also the application now gives error after the codebase changes. use similar methodology / approach shown in the the reference response to provide a fix for the latest application error.

excellent job again! keep using the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully review the attached documents and then use line by line validation of the actual codebase to create a *complete* updated *replacement* for these two documents (README.md and TDS) that incorporates the latest changes to the codebase. Your updated version should reflect the current codebase accurately. 

---
please create for me a *complete* updated *replacement* for `README.md`, and it must be the appropriate GitHub repo style README.md (use the draft document attached here as your reference). do not just copy verbatim, use line by line diff of the current project codebase to create an accurate and relevant README.md. keep in mind that the README.md must be suitable as a GitHub repo and not another normal technical document. And the updated complete README.md must be self-contained without reference to any prior revisions (versions) of the same document, meaning incorporate details from the earlier versions into your self-contained full version of the document.

you must do your due diligence and think deeply and explore for the best possible way to come up with an awesome GitHub style README.md

Below is "diff" command output comparing the previous version with your latest generated version. Please double-check and validate that the changes are valid and that no other original features or functions are lost (omitted). use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to review the diff output below.

Did you accidentally omitted other lines from the previous version? Remember, we need to give benefit of doubt to harmless lines or sections.

---
Please carefully review and validate the recently added tests files to the codebase, enclosed in the `recently_created_tests_code_files_for_your_review_and_validation.md` file shared earlier. The create a detailed step-by-step guide, `project_test_guide.md` (markdown format), on how to run the tests given the newly added tests code files.

Then create a *complete* updated replacement file for `README.md` that includes all the recent changes, including the added tests code files. Make sure you create a *complete* and fully self-contained `README.md` that incorporates all the relevant sections from the previous versions. I don't want to keep referring to previous versions for missing details in your latest `README.md` Instead of simply saying "this section remained unchanged from previous version",  just copy and adapt the relevant sections from the previous versions. I will delete all older versions of `README.md` and will only keep your latest `README.md` to be created.

Please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to think deeply and systematically to explore carefully and thoroughly for the various implementation options to fix the following issues, then choose the best implementation option to create a detailed execution plan with integrated checklist to make the code changes to fix the issues. always plan before you execute step by step, and always create *complete* updated *replacement* files for the files that need updating. always use line-by-line "diff" to carefully review and validate the code changes made for each file as it is being updated or created. complete all the line-by-line diff comparison and validation before giving a task completion review and conclusion at the end of your response.
