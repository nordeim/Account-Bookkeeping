excellent understanding! now help me to carefully review my codebase line by line to gain a complete and deep understanding of the project's goals and current state and structure. then help me to create a detailed `Project Architecture Document.md` in markdown format. make sure the document accurately describes the codebase accurately and in detail, use a clear diagram to show the codebase relationship.

you have done an awesome job again! keep using the same rigorous and meticulous approach to systematically going forwards. now help carefully review the recent changes made to the database schema and codebase shared in the attached files. very carefully review the content of the code changes, then think deeply to evaluate and validate them, then update your `Project Architecture Document (v2).md` to reflect the latest development accurately. Pay particular attention to the schema and initial data updates, to double check and confirm that they did not accidentally leave out (omit) other features and functions in the original versions. As you know, any changes to the database schema and initial data setup have to be scrutinized carefully and validated to ensure completeness and correctness.

Also the application now gives error after the codebase changes:

Also the application now gives error after the codebase changes. use similar methodology / approach shown in the the reference response to provide a fix for the latest application error.

excellent job again! keep using the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully review the attached documents and then use line by line validation of the actual codebase to create a *complete* updated *replacement* for these two documents (README.md and TDS) that incorporates the latest changes to the codebase. Your updated version should reflect the current codebase accurately.
