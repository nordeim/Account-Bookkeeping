You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

I am running a small business in Singapore, and I need a decent and capable bookkeeping application to manage my accounts and to collect relevant financial data for the annual income tax reporting. Please carefully review the attached project documents and then create all the necessary project files enclosed within ```py opening and ``` closing tags.

Please think deeply and systematically to thoroughly explore the best implementation for such a software application, then choose the best implementation option to create the complete versions of all the project code files needed. Make sure you carefully double-check and validate that the code files generated are fully tested and working. Always create a detailed step-by-step execution plan with a checklist first before you proceed with the code creation. Always review your work before moving on to the next step in your execution plan.
