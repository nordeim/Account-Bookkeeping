please carefully review the errors and then plan to fix them. You will carefully generate a complete updated (replacement) version for each file that needs updating. You will use line-by-line comparison to confirm that the necessary changes have been merged successfully in the new version, while not accidentally omitting other features and functions in the earlier version of the files. Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

Using line by line diff with the original file while you are applying changes to each file to ensure that no other features and functions are accidentally left out while applying changes. we don't want to introduce regression failure while updating the code. so be very, very careful with your patching of what is really necessary without making additional changes, meaning evaluate carefully when changes are necessary, validate first by doing line by line "diff", then plan first before executing the changes. Do testing and simulation if possible. enclose your complete and updated version of the updated files within the ```python (or ```js or ```sql or ```json) opening and ``` closing tags. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

Remember you are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

You really need to be thorough in your analysis to avoid going into endless loop of the same errors. Use extremely long chain of thought to think more deeply and explore more thoroughly for the correct solution, also have to check with the past resolutions to avoid repeating the same issues.

excellent result so far! please proceed with the next step in your plan to close any gap in the core feature set of the application as noted in your updated TDS. remember to explore carefully for multiple implementation options before choosing the most optimal and elegant solution to implement the changes. so you have to think deeply and systematically to explore all options and not just choose any option you may think of. also make sure you make a detailed execution plan with an integrated checklist for each step, before proceeding cautiously step by step. after completing each step, always double-check and validate your changes for that step against its checklist before proceeding to the next step. remember to always create a *complete* and updated replacement or new file for the affected files, enclose each complete and updated replacement file within ```py (or ```sql or ```js or or ```ts or ```tsx ```php extension) opening and ``` closing tags. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file.

The important point is to proceed very carefully so as not to introduce any regression error or accidentally omit the original features or functions. use the same tested rigorous and meticulous approach. thank you and good luck!

Excellent result so far! Please proceed with the next step in your plan for the implementation of "the basic Customer Management module". If this has been completed, please carefully update the README.md and TDS documents for the project to carefully and accurately detail the current state of the project. Please proceed very carefully so as not to introduce any regression error or accidentally omit the original features or functions. use the same tested rigorous and meticulous approach. thank you and good luck!

please carefully study the README.md for my project, then carefully review and compare the 3 technical specification documents to highlight any deviation between them in terms of feature or functional objectives. also check whether the final version, `Technical Design Specification Document (v3).md`, is consistent with the objectives stated in `README.md` for the project.

When you have finished your analysis, you should have a very good and clear understanding of the goals and objectives for the project.

---
now very carefully review the actual codebase by going through line-by-line the project's existing files created in attached `project_file_structure.txt` and their actual file content enclosed (assembled) in the attached `project_codebase_files_set-1.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-2.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-3.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-4.md` and `project_codebase_files_set-5.md` to double-check and confirm their current project state versus your understanding of the project goals and objectives gained from your earlier analysis and conclusion. 

---
please help me create a complete updated replacement file for `README.md` and `Technical_Design_Specification_Document.md` that includes the current state as the codebase you just reviewed. I want to delete the old revisions of the respective file because it is a pain to cross reference each and every time. your complete updated replacement file for each should consolidate all the information in the older revisions plus the additional status update based on the current (reviewed) codebase. meaning your updated complete replacement file for each should be self contained with all the information, including the current state.

---
excellent result so far! please proceed with the next step in your plan to cover the main Roadmap goals as noted in your updated README.md. remember to explore carefully for multiple implementation options before choosing the most optimal and elegant solution to implement the changes. so you have to think deeply and systematically to explore all options and not just choose any option you may think of. also make sure you make a detailed execution plan with an integrated checklist for each step, before proceeding cautiously step by step. after completing each step, always double-check and validate your changes for that step against its checklist before proceeding to the next step. remember to always create a *complete* and updated replacement or new file for the affected files, enclose each complete and updated replacement file within ```py (or ```sql or ```js or or ```ts or ```tsx ```php extension) opening and ``` closing tags. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file.

Please carefully study the README.md, including the older revisions, for my project, then carefully review and compare all the attached technical specification documents to highlight any deviation between them in terms of feature or functional objectives. Also check whether the final version of `Technical Design Specification Document.md`, is consistent with the objectives stated in `README.md` for the project.

When you have finished your careful review and analysis of the project documents, make sure you have a very thorough, good and clear understanding of the goals and objectives for the project. Acknowledge your understand, describe in detail your understanding of the project in markdown format.

---
now very carefully review the actual codebase by going through line-by-line the project's existing files created in attached `currect_project_file_structure.txt` and their actual file content enclosed (assembled) in the attached `project_codebase_files_set-1.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-2.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-3.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-4.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-5.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-6.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-7.md` and `project_codebase_files_set-8.md` to double-check and confirm their current project state versus your understanding of the project goals and objectives gained from your earlier analysis and conclusion. 

Make sure you have very deep and thorough understanding of the current state of the project through the careful review of the actual project files enclosed. Then create a complete updated architectural understanding document in markdown format, building on your earlier document. Add very detailed architecture description of the actual current codebase, add a clear architectural diagram as well in your updated document.

---
now help me to carefully review the most recent code changes committed and validate them. also make sure you adopt the same style of careful, rigorous and meticulous approach to handle future feature addition and bug fix requests. give me a good summary of the recent code changes and their robustness and stability.

---
you have done a really awesome job so far! do keep up the same quality of work going forwards! now help me create a complete and updated `README.md` and `Technical_Design_Specification_Document.md` which are self-contained without any reference to the older revisions. You should incorporate the relevant sections from the older revisions of the respective document to your updated version so that anyone reading it should not have to look for the older revisions for additional details. the reason for doing this is because I want to delete all the older revisions of these documents because it has become a pain to reference so many versions of the same document. so again create a *complete* updated version with no reference to prior versions of the same document, and make sure all the valid sections and details from the revisions are incorporated.

---
Help me to carefully review the recent changes to my project codebase by validating the series of responses attached. Relevant project documents are attached for you to review to have a deep understanding about the project and its goals and objectives. Validate whether the recent changes have been made correctly in accordance to the project goals.

---
Excellent work so far! Please adopt the same meticulous approach to identifying and resolving these issues as demonstrated in the series of responses for the previous successful debugging and enhancement session. Going forward, you shall have similar commitment to code quality. Please acknowledge your commitment. Thank you!

---
Please carefully review the current project codebase whose files are enclosed in the attached `project_codebase_files_set-1.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-2.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-3.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-4.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-5.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-6.md` and `currect_project_file_structure.txt` files. Then validate them against your understanding of the project's goals and objectives as spelled out in the project documents you reviewed earlier. Give a very detailed report on your review findings and your assessment on the current codebase and its current status, also give your conclusion and recommendations in markdown format. Also provide a very detailed execution plan with checklist to cover the issues and recommendations identified as well as the current and medium term roadmaps. Please use the absolute rigorous, meticulous and systematic approach to carefully review and validate the codebase and then generate your assessment report with recommendations and a separate execution plan with integrated checklist to bring the project to a production state. thank you and good luck!

Hope, this incidence is an important  lesson for you not to remove seemingly unnecessary sections or lines because they may be there for some reason. When you generate a complete *updated* replacement file for an existing file, give benefit of doubt to the seemingly unnecessary sections or lines *as long as they are harmless*. Remove them only if they cause conflict or interfere with the newly added code.

Now, I want you to recall whether you have removed seemingly unnecessary sections or lines of code that are *harmless* in any of your earlier response?

Please validate the update in schema.sql after carefully reviewing the attached recommended code change.

can you carefully and thoroughly and deeply review all the documents shared earlier to have a good context and grounding for the project, then refine and re-validate your conclusion on `scripts/schema.sql-new`?

---
Please carefully and deeply review the current codebase shared here as `currect_project_file_structure.txt`, `project_codebase_files_set-2.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-4.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-6.md project_codebase_files_set-1.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-3.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-5.md`, and `project_codebase_files_set-7.md` files.

The current project folder structure is shown in `currect_project_file_structure.txt` and all the current project code files are enclosed in `project_codebase_files_set-2.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-4.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-6.md project_codebase_files_set-1.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-3.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-5.md`, and `project_codebase_files_set-7.md` files.

Make sure you have a good grounding on the current state of the project based on the current codebase shared here. Then cross reference them with your earlier understanding of the project based on your earlier review of the project documentation shared earlier. Give me a detail architecture overview of the the current state of the project based on this current codebase study.

Next, with a good grounding of the current codebase, do a careful re-validation of your newly generated files for `scripts/schema.sql`, `app/utils/pydantic_models.py`, `app/services/audit_services.py`, and `app/models/business/bank_transaction.py`. It is good practice to do due diligence.
