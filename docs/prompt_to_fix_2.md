awesome job so far! now use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully review the current code and config files attached here, then think deeply and systematically to carefully and thoroughly explore the best implementation option to fix following issues, then choose the best implementation option to carefully merge the validated changes to the existing code files, taking care not to loose other features and functions while making the changes. Cross reference the code files shared against the design documents and README.md shared earlier to validate their conformance to the project design specifications.

*Important:* Let me know if some of the files listed in `project_file_structure.txt` is not provided yet. Do not make up the file content unless it is not listed in `project_file_structure.txt`.

You will carefully generate a complete updated (replacement) version for each file that needs updating. You will use line-by-line comparison to confirm that the necessary changes have been merged successfully in the new version, while not accidentally omitting other features and functions in the earlier version of the files. Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

Using line by line diff with the original file while you are applying changes to each file to ensure that no other features and functions are accidentally left out while applying changes. we don't want to introduce regression failure while updating the code. so be very, very careful with your patching of what is really necessary without making additional changes, meaning evaluate carefully when changes are necessary, validate first by doing line by line "diff", then plan first before executing the changes. Do testing and simulation if possible. enclose your complete and updated version of the updated files within the ```python (or ```js or ```sql or ```json) opening and ``` closing tags. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

Remember you are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

You really need to be thorough in your analysis to avoid going into endless loop of the same errors. Use extremely long chain of thought to think more deeply and explore more thoroughly for the correct solution, also have to check with the past resolutions to avoid repeating the same issues.

Is everything looking good? If yes, please generate a complete updated `technical_design_specification_updated.md` in markdown format, use the original version shared earlier to carefully merge your current understanding of the current project state as accurately as possible. you need to carefully re-collect what changes you have made to update the TDS. Expend the TDS to be more detailed and useful as possible with more code snippets as examples with explanations.

Also create a complete updated `README.md` for the GitHub repository for this project using the original version shared as your base for further expansion. Make your updated `README.md` as information and as detailed as possible. Make it attractive for more contributors.

Again use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to create updated version of the above-mentioned documents.

you have some an absolutely awesome job so far to get the product running! well done! now, help me to think deeply and systematically to explore carefully and thoroughly for the best implementation option to create the missing files that are needed to cover the core functionalities of a bookkeeping app. I am launching a trial of this product so I want it to at least meet the basic needs of such a software. Since you are an absolute expert in accounting for Singapore's regulatory environment, please try your very best to help me out to make the product trial a success. Thank you and good luck!

you have done an excellent analysis and assessment! the plan for the next phase that you just outlined is fantastic! now, please use the same careful, rigorous and meticulous approach to build the next set of files according to your plan step by step. for each step, plan the detailed specifications, then validate them before making changes. validate the files again for their correctness before proceeding with the next step. Now please proceed to help me out! again, do your best and give me a pleasant surprise!

excellent result so far! please proceed with the next step in your plan. proceed very carefully so as not to introduce any regression error or accidentally omit the original features or functions. use the same tested rigorous and meticulous approach. thank you and good luck!

please carefully study the README.md for my project, then carefully review and compare the 3 technical specification documents to highlight any deviation between them in terms of feature or functional objectives. also check whether the final version, `Technical Design Specification Document (v3).md`, is consistent with the objectives stated in `README.md` for the project.

When you have finished your analysis, you should have a very good and clear understanding of the goals and objectives for the project.

---
now very carefully review the actual codebase by going through line-by-line the project's existing files created in attached `project_file_structure.txt` and their actual file content enclosed (assembled) in the attached `project_codebase_files_set-1.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-2.md`, `project_codebase_files_set-3.md` and `project_codebase_files_set-4.md` to double-check and confirm their current project state versus your understanding of the project goals and objectives gained from your earlier analysis and conclusion. 

---
excellent work! now, work out a detailed plan with integrated check list to dress any coding and logic errors and to address any functional gaps and inconsistencies. you can use the attached `next_phase_detailed_plan.md` and proposed modification suggestions in `you_will_carefully_review_and_validated_attached_proposed_changes_before_adopting_what_are_necessary.md`as reference input for your own consideration and deliberation. do your own due diligence and leverage your own intelligence and expertise to refine and adapt - do not just copy.

map out in your enhancement execution plan (incorporates checklist) the files to be created (complete and updated replacement or new files) in logical sequence, the goals and purpose of each file to be created, their interfaces with other files, etc. 

---
you have done an excellent job with the detailed execution plan for the next phase which is to address identified issues and close functional gaps in the current project codebase. now use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully and systematically create complete and updated replacement or new files to complete this plan step by step. make sure to enclose each file created like how the original files shared are enclosed (start with `# <filename with path relative to project root folder>`, follow by ```extension opening tag and ``` closing tag). Make sure to carefully review, double-check and validate each file created using line-by-line "diff" command to confirm it meets its goals and specifications. now proceed to create and modify the relevant files according to your plan systematically and rigorously.
