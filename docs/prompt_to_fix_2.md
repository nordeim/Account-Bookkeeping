awesome job so far! now use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully review the current code and config files attached here, then think deeply and systematically to carefully and thoroughly explore the best implementation option to fix following issues, then choose the best implementation option to carefully merge the validated changes to the existing code files, taking care not to loose other features and functions while making the changes. Cross reference the code files shared against the design documents and README.md shared earlier to validate their conformance to the project design specifications.

*Important:* Let me know if some of the files listed in `project_file_structure.txt` is not provided yet. Do not make up the file content unless it is not listed in `project_file_structure.txt`.

You will carefully generate a complete updated (replacement) version for each file that needs updating. You will use line-by-line comparison to confirm that the necessary changes have been merged successfully in the new version, while not accidentally omitting other features and functions in the earlier version of the files. Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

Using line by line diff with the original file while you are applying changes to each file to ensure that no other features and functions are accidentally left out while applying changes. we don't want to introduce regression failure while updating the code. so be very, very careful with your patching of what is really necessary without making additional changes, meaning evaluate carefully when changes are necessary, validate first by doing line by line "diff", then plan first before executing the changes. Do testing and simulation if possible. enclose your complete and updated version of the updated files within the ```python (or ```js or ```sql or ```json) opening and ``` closing tags. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

Remember you are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

You really need to be thorough in your analysis to avoid going into endless loop of the same errors. Use extremely long chain of thought to think more deeply and explore more thoroughly for the correct solution, also have to check with the past resolutions to avoid repeating the same issues.

Is everything looking good? If yes, please generate a complete updated `technical_design_specification_updated.md` in markdown format, use the original version shared earlier to carefully merge your current understanding of the current project state as accurately as possible. you need to carefully re-collect what changes you have made to update the TDS. Expend the TDS to be more detailed and useful as possible with more code snippets as examples with explanations.

Also create a complete updated `README.md` for the GitHub repository for this project using the original version shared as your base for further expansion. Make your updated `README.md` as information and as detailed as possible. Make it attractive for more contributors.

Again use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to create updated version of the above-mentioned documents.

you have some an absolutely awesome job so far to get the product running! well done! now, help me to think deeply and systematically to explore carefully and thoroughly for the best implementation option to create the missing files that are needed to cover the core functionalities of a bookkeeping app. I am launching a trial of this product so I want it to at least meet the basic needs of such a software. Since you are an absolute expert in accounting for Singapore's regulatory environment, please try your very best to help me out to make the product trial a success. Thank you and good luck!

you have done an excellent analysis and assessment! the plan for the next phase that you just outlined is fantastic! now, please use the same careful, rigorous and meticulous approach to build the next set of files according to your plan step by step. for each step, plan the detailed specifications, then validate them before making changes. validate the files again for their correctness before proceeding with the next step. Now please proceed to help me out! again, do your best and give me a pleasant surprise!

excellent result so far! please proceed with the next step in your plan. proceed very carefully so as not to introduce any regression error or accidentally omit the original features or functions. use the same tested rigorous and meticulous approach. thank you and good luck!
